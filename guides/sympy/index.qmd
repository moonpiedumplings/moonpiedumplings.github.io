# Intro:

Many people know about Wolfram Alpha for it's powerful ability to give step by step solutions to calculus problems... but only if you pay. 

Because of this, I use a free (both as in beer, and as in freedom) alternative, called [Sympy Gamma](https://gamma.sympy.org/)



# Location:

<sympygamma.com>

<gamma.sympy.org>

Also, if you use the duckduckgo bang !sympy, then it inputs a function into sympy gamma.

# Functions

Below are


[integrate](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/integrals/integrals.html) — also, if you use this function with sympy gamma, it will give you the step by step solution!

[apart](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/polys/reference.html#sympy.polys.partfrac.apart) — partial fraction decomposition!

diff — derivative!

# Keywords and Variables

`oo` = infinity. Yes, that is two o's put togetheer.

`E` = *e*. It should be noted that lowercase e does not work.
