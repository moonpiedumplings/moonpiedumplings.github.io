Here are some idea for future blog posts, projects, or talks.


- Synced music and podcasts:
    - multiple mpd servers, dedicate to either a playlist or a podcasts
    - This syncs session

something like: https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/99zvxk/is_it_possible_to_route_audio_from_pc_to_android/

- Education/Teaching people linx
    - Lie to children

- Threat model
    - Please install an adblocker


- Tryhackme/hackthebox/overthewire beginner lab
    - https://shell.segfault.net/# : Free, online root servers (no public ip, but you do get a public port blocked by CSUN internet)
    - killercoda
    -  


— Library Science presentation
    - "Google It" — and Why that's not enough
    - Vetting sources for programmers/ops people
    - Goes into how certain organizations (google, canonical, etc) are run and how it effects the documentation they do (or don't) push out


- Ventoy guide
    - test if ventoy files can be accessed while live iso is booted
    - yes it can, but this is a linux only feature

- ublacklist (search engine filter extension) guide/blogpost


- Ovirt
    - Seems to support port security
    - Seems to support multi user and single sign on

Software Projects:
- Chessbase alternative
    - Must be able to search games by position: eg pawn's here and here, or general structure, eg "benoni
        - Could be implemented by searching for pawn moves in the PGN
    - Must be able to search for things like "bishop sacrifice" and the like
    - Engine analysis, ofc. Maybe analyze all available moves rather than just the few best.
    - someone
