The layer8 Cybersecurity club as Cal State Northridge asked me to do a talk on linux containers (not to be confused with [LXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC)).

In this presentation, I talk a bit about the history of containers, types, and the various ways you can run a container on a system.

I recorded it, although the recording isn't very good. In addition to that, the slides are also public, and they are [linked here](./revealjs.qmd)
