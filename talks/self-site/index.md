For the Layer8 Cybersecurity club here at Cal State Northridge, and potentially more clubs, I will do a presentation on how I set up my site with Github pages, and how to set up your own site.

Currently, this is only WIP, as I haven't finished with the slides, the site template, or the presentation. 

Slides are [linked here](./revealjs.md)
