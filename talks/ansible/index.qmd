Recently, [I wrote a lot of ansible roles and playbooks for the CCDC competition](https://github.com/CSUN-CCDC/CCDC-2023/commits?author=moonpiedumplings). 

Here is a link to the roles: <https://github.com/CSUN-CCDC/CCDC-2023/tree/main/linux/ansible/roles>

These ansible "roles," cover a variety of tasks that the cybersecurity competition would require from us, including things like managing firewalls (ufw, iptables, firewalld), shuffling passwords of linux users or databases, or doing backups. 

Professor Doris Chaney asked me to present on how to use ansible, so here is where the presentation, code, and guide will go.

The presentation can be [found here](./revealjs.qmd)


Sadly, although I did the presentation, and it went well including recording it, I did not get the okay from Prof. Chaney to post presentation recording to this public, at least this season.
