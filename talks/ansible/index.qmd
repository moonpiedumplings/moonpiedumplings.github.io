Recently, [I wrote a lot of ansible roles and playbooks for the CCDC competition](https://github.com/CSUN-CCDC/CCDC-2023/commits?author=moonpiedumplings). 

Here is a link to the roles: <https://github.com/CSUN-CCDC/CCDC-2023/tree/main/linux/ansible/roles>

These ansible "roles," cover a variety of tasks that the cybersecurity competition would require from us, including things like managing firewalls (ufw, iptables, firewalld), shuffling passwords of linux users or databases, or doing backups. 

Professor Doris Chaney asked me to present on how to use ansible, so here is where the presentation, code, and guide will go.

The presentation can be [found here](./revealjs.qmd)


I have the recording, but I need to edit it a little bit before I post it.
