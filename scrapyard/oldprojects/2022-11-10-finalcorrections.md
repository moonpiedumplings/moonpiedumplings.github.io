# Corrections:

On problem  41, I simply read too fast, and missed this.

Pseudocode:

```
p = 10
q = 20
r = 30
s = 40
p = q # sets the value of P to the value of q. I missed this part
q = r
s = q
r = p # p is not 10, it got set to 20. 

```

Because I missed the earlier, when asked for the value of r, I answered 10, when the correct answer is 20. 

# Things I had to google:

I actually did have to google something, only one thing. On one of the internet questions, I had to google whether or not packets could be in order, which is not the case. Packets can be an any order, even TCP packets (I had incorrectly thought TCP packets had to be in order).
