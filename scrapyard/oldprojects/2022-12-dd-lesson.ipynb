    "- `HaltChecker` analyzes the program,`program P`, and its input,`input I`. If `program P` halts with `input I`, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"halts\". If `program P` doesn't halt(runs forever) with `input I`, `HaltChecker` returns an output of \"never\". For example, in the code where it tests if variable **number**, the ________, so `HaltChecker` returns an output of ________.\n",
    "- Then, we add another algorithm called `Reverser` which reverses `HaltChecker`'s output. So, if \"never\" is the output of `HaltChecker`, then the output of `Reverser` is ________. It's also the same the other way around: if `HaltChecker` has an output of \"halts\", then `Reverser` has an output of ________.\n",
    "- We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code.\n",
    "- **Since `Reverser` is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints \"never\" when in fact there is an end(As proved by `HaltChecker`), and how it also prints \"halts\" when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by `HaltChecker`). As a result, `HaltChecker` is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem.**\n",
