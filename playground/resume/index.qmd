I am trying to generate a two column resume, but nothign I have tried has been able to output to both pdf and html format. So I am now trying to generate a resume using jupyter and pythons graph generating capabilities. 


I found an [example](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-a-resume-in-python-1480a4d6a399) online, but it has syntax errors when I try to run it, and I also don't know what the code is liscensed under, so I think I will try to write my own. 

First, I need to select a graphics library. They used matplotlib, but I will search for an easier way to do it first. 


```{python}
from ipywidgets import interact, interactive, fixed, interact_manual
import ipywidgets as widgets

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

import numpy as np

def plot_func(freq):
    x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi)
    y = np.sin(x * freq)
    plt.plot(x, y)

interact(plot_func, freq = widgets.FloatSlider(value=7.5,
                                               min=1,
                                               max=5.0,
                                               step=0.5))
```


I found another [guide](https://www.iceorfire.com/post/resume-generation-with-python) to write a resume with html, and then convert it to pdf with python, but I don't really want that.
