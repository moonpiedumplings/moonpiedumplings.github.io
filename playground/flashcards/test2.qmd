# {.center}

::: {.r-stack}
Albedo
:::

## {.center}

::: {.r-stack}
How reflective an object or substance is
:::

## {.center}

::: {.r-stack}
Measured in percentage of electromagnetic radiation reflected
:::

# {.center}

::: {.r-stack}
Adiabatic cooling/lapse rates
:::

## {.center}

Dry: 10 (actually 9.8) C° per 1000 meters (1 km). 

Wet/Saturated: 6 (actually 5.5) C⁰ per 1000 meters. 

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Adiabatic compression
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
When a gas is compressed without exchaning heat with it's surroundings. This results in the temperature of the gas increasing (or vice versa). 
:::

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Type of fog: evaporative
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Cold air, in the prescense of a warmer water surface. Water evaporates into the colder air, saturated it, and becoming fog. 
:::

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Type of fog: advection
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Warm air from ocean is cooled to dew point
:::

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Type of fog: upslope
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Moist air rises and cools, reaching the dew point. 
:::

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Type of fog: radiation
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Warmer air in the presense of a cold surface. Heat transfers from air to cold surface, and as this air cools, the moisture in it condenses into the 
:::

::: {r-stack}
Haze vs Fog?
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
The former is dust, salt, or other particles in the atmosphere. The latter is essentially a cloud on the ground. 
:::

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Nuclei
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Small (microscopic) particles in the air. Hygroscopic nuclei attract water, hydrophic avoid it.

::: {r-stack}
Long, thin, and wispy cloud type
:::

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Dew point
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Temperature at which air must be cooled for water vapor to condense.

::: {r-stack}
Dynamics
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
When air pressure is affected by the convergence or divergence of air masses, which can be caused by heat, or 
:::

# {.center}

::: {r-stack}
Daltons Law
:::

## {.center}

::: {r-stack}
States that pressure of water vapor and other debris in air + air itself is equal to total pressure.
