I recently went to a conference where someone mentioned something called a "Fly away kit", which is essentially a server in a suitcase. "They may or may not be used for mobile threat hunting". 

Although I'm not really personally interested in an "[In Line Network Tap](https://solutions.nextcomputing.com/products/fly-away-kits/)", or "[meshed network nodes](meshed network nodes)", I do find the idea of a server in a suitcase to be very cool. It would be much easier to transfer around than a normal tower server form factor.

But, many of the "fly away kits" I've found have one thing in common: They won't tell you the price. And that indirectly tells me that I can't afford the price. 

Perhaps making my own would be cheaper? 

I don't plan to actually make one. But it's a fun thought experiment.

# The Case

The first step is the case. Recommened in a [relevant reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/zog6n4/the_suitcase_server_project/
) were [Pelican Cases](https://business.pelican.com/discover/rack-mount-server-cases). Simply put, they could store a rack mount server, within a suit case, which is what I want to do.

Interestingly, [one fly away kit](https://www.forescout.com/products/flyaway-kit/) manufacturer seems to be doing exactly this, putting an Intel Xeon server in a Pelican Suitcase.

Another thing about pelican cases, is that it's possible to find [used cases on ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=pelican+rack&_sacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313), which is much cheaper than something completely new. 

# The Server

Pelican server rack cases have a certain set of dimensions, and are slightly smaller than what an average rack server will fit into.  I may require a [half rack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit#Half-rack_configurations) server for this.

# UPS

Power is also needed!

It's important to have some way to power the server for short or long periods it may be away from a plug while it is moved. 

# Network
