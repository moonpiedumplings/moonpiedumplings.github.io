So I was browsing around, and I found this public pastebin.

`klovenierm6@193.233.202.76` where the password is `bDBShj`

It seemed like a crypto wallet reset password? But why post this in a pastebin? It seemed suspicious, but I decided to log in.

Wow. $10000 worth of Bitcoin, right there for me to take. It seems to good to be true. 

So, I spun up a wallet and attempted to deposit the money into it. 

![](images/depositfirst.png)

Wow. In order to withdraw the money first, to an unverified account, I first have to deposit around $2000 worth of Bitcoin into their account. 

Obviously, this is a scam. It's a fairly common pattern, "Here's free money, but first, send me some money." But this is such an interesting technological twist, I couldn't not blog about it. 

But I decided to experiment a little further.

Nmap is a port scanning utility that tells you what people are running on their server. 

So I attempted to connect to their other services. I tried to connect to both vnc servers first, but for both, I got a server not found error. This is probably because those services aren't up for public usage, as shown by the `filtered` state they return in the nmap scan. I suspect that they have a firewall that only allows for certain IP addresses or something like that. 

I also tried to connect to the ssh service on port 2222, but it kicked me out saying I needed a public key. 


Oooh, a scan later in the day (around 4-5 hours later) is differerent.

There appear to have taken the amt-soap-http service offline. Good security protocol, getting rid of uneeded services, minimizing the attack surface, but do they really need those vnc servers?

I decided to do a little more searching. 

I first searched google, and only the same pastebin came up, which has since been taken offline. 

I did find something interesting by searching on github:

But upon going through that repo, it was simply someone's pastebin archiving repo. And in addition to that, the servers in those that I found, I have since been taken offline.
