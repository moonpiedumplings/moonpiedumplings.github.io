# The What

I want a whole "cloud" for myself and people around me. The services I want to host are:

* Authentik — Single Sign On and centralized accounts
* Incus — to provide VPS's to people
* Coder — for remote development environments, but also Kali/Linux containers accessible via the browser
* Forgejo — Code forge, with CI/CD
* Nextcloud — a "cloud" with file sync, editing, and the like
* Element Server Suite — A complete discord alternative
* Something for Large Language Models
  * Preferably with history per OIDC user
  * Probably: <https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/open-webui/open-webui>, [see also](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/483)


# The Why

In my [previous project](../build-server-5/), I attempted to deploy [Openstack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack) entirely with [GitOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#GitOps) methodologies, using [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/).

I failed. Well, it didn't fail, but I think I've spent too long on it and I need to move on.

Recently, I've discovered a project that simultaneously seems to be a distribution of OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Linux, called [StarlingX](https://www.starlingx.io/).

Also:

> [StarlingX OpenStack is installed and managed as an FluxCD application.](https://docs.starlingx.io/system_configuration/index-sysconf-d511820651f0.html#starlingx-openstack)

Now, StarlingX, sadly, is not GitOps OpenStack. Configurations to the OpenStack application are done via the command line, or via helm value files. Perhaps I can clone the flux repo they use, but truthfully, I'm not going to worry about it for now.

# StarlingX Attempt

There are multiple deployment guides, but I am interested in the ["Simplex"](https://docs.starlingx.io/r/stx.10.0/deploy_install_guides/release/bare_metal/aio_simplex_install_kubernetes.html) install, which documents how to do an All in One install, using a single server, which is all I have.

I also care a lot about "For OpenStack only: Configure data interfaces for controller-0. Data class interfaces are vSwitch interfaces used by vSwitch to provide VM virtio vNIC connectivity to OpenStack Neutron Tenant Networks on the underlying assigned Data Network.", since I only have one physical interface in use, and the other one will be virtual.

I started by obtaining an ISO, and attempting to install it in a virtual machine. The installer crashed becasue it wanted 500 GB of storage... which is fair I guess.At least it doesn't crash because I don't have enough CPU cores or ram.

Just kidding. It doesn't boot. I don't know why. Instead it stays stuck on "booting on hard disk". This probably would work better on a physical machine, but I want to make sure it works on a virtual machine first.

But I install it on my physical server anyways. It doesn't get an ip address via dhcp.

I understand why people like turnkey solutions, like ESXI now.

I look into another HCI solution: [Suse Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/). It's actually a very good software, the UI is great and the install is easy. But if you want any kind of authorization and control over who can see what projects, you have to deploy rancher, which can then "consume" the harvester api and work with it. While excellent, I don't really feel like having to set up rancher either on another server, or in a virtual machine.

In addition to that, I could not figure out how networking works, and how to set up a bridged network. I did deploy a virtual machine, although at first I accidentally gave it 1000 Gi of ram and it would not run because my machine does not have 1000 Gi of ram.

Also, I did find something funny though:

![](images/editor.jpg)


But at this point, I was done, and I began looking into something else, [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/).

Incus:

-   Can be installed on top of another distro
-   Has networking I understand, "simply" bridging
-   Has [authorization and authentication](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/#tls-authorization) by restricting TLS certs to a project
    -   Not the complex SSO I want, but I need *something* working

Incus also has some nice features, like it can access a [repository](https://images.linuxcontainers.org/) of LXC images (similar to Dockerhub), which is cool for testing out many different Linux distros.

Anyway, I did actually attempt to deploy it using Debian backports.

```         
root@b718c16e3b2d:/etc/apt/sources.list.d# apt install incus
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 incus : Depends: qemu-system-x86 (>= 1:8.0) but 1:7.2+dfsg-7+deb12u12 is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

Disappointing.

Instead, I followed the instructions on the [github](https://github.com/zabbly/incus)... mostly.

``` {.default filename="/etc/apt/sources.list.d/zabbly-incus-lts-6.0.sources"}
Enabled: yes
Types: deb
URIs: https://pkgs.zabbly.com/incus/lts-6.0
Suites: bookworm
Components: main
Architectures: amd64
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/zabbly.asc
```

This is a container, I will test a virtual machine install later on.

# Installing Debian

<https://wiki.debian.org/UEFI#Force_grub-efi_installation_to_the_removable_media_path> — gotta do this in the installer


# Networking

Switch from ifupdown/iproute2 to NetworkManager

``` {.default filename="/etc/network/interfaces"}
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
#allow-hotplug enp0s25
#iface enp0s25 inet dhcp
```

Comment out network interfaces.

``` {.default filename="/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf"}
[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile

[ifupdown]
managed=true
```

And changed "managed" to true instead of false.

Once I do this, I use cockpit to convert the main network interface into a bridge that also a ethernet interface.

So I got incus working. In a new/incognito tab, you can go to `/ui/login`, and follow the instructions to set up the UI.

I attempt to set up an Alpine instance, with the network attatched directly to my ethernet/bridge combo. Yeah, that was a bad idea, as it took my network offline.

Instead, I decided to create a veth, and then attatch that to my bridge (openstack style... ugh. I can't believe I'm doing this again).

`nmcli con add type veth ifname veth1 con-name veth1 veth.peer eth1`

And then add the `veth1` as a port to the `eth0` bridge.

And then after that:

`incus network create public0 bridge.external_interfaces=eth1 ipv4.address=none ipv4.dhcp=false ipv6.address=none ipv6.dhcp=false`

This essentially creates a public network with no dns and dhcp. Instead, vitual machines will get their required address via dhcp — and they do!

But I realize something: I have two ethernet ports available to me, but I am only using one of them. I should use either a bond or a team to combine them into one, and then convert *that* merged interface into a bridge that also acts as an ethernet port.

Based on [this comparison chart](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-comparison_of_network_teaming_to_bonding#sec-Comparison_of_Network_Teaming_to_Bonding), it looks like Teaming is better.

```         
root@thoth:~# speedtest

```

It looks like my upload and download is capped at 100 Mbit/s. Let's see if we can double that.

Okay, but it looks like [teaming has been deprecated](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/if-you-bonding-you-will-love-teaming) — but in Red Hat, or in general? My Debian system still seems to be able to set up teaming.

Okay, but now that I know I want bonding, [which mode do I want](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt)? Some modes seem to require configuration on the switch, which rules them out, but I want best performance from the modes I can use.

Testing time!

I did two kinds of tests: one with `speedtest`, and another with `speedtest & speedtest & speedtest`, to see if more in parallel would have different results.

Better than would it would be alone, but it still seems bad.

| Bond Method Used | Single Speedtest (Mbit/s) | Triple Speedtest Down | Triple Speedtest Up |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| No Bond | 93.59 down, 86.25 up | 30.12, 29.33, 23.13 | 41.62 Mbit/32.98, 52.79 |
| balance-alb | 93.60 down, 91.53 up |  |  |
| balance-rr | 99.95 down, 161.43 up | 58.96, 59.08, 61.67 | 59.84, 57.80, 59.80 |
| balance-tlb | 93.60 down, 87.51 up |  |  |
| 802.3ad / LACP | 93 down, 90 up | 32, 32, 28 | 31, 27, 29 |
| balance-xor |  | 35, 37, 17 | 38, 35, 46 |

Okay, that's enough enough speedtest tests, I should probably switch to `iperf3` to test parallel connections properly.

`iperf3 -c ping.online.net -p 5203`

Iperf testing:

| Bond Method Used | Single Stream (mbit/s) | Multi stream (mbit/s total) |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| No bond          | 77 (average), 94 (top) |                             |
| 802.3ad / LAP    | 94 , 77                | 80, 70 (no improvement...)  |
| Round Robin      | 120                    | 167, 143                    |
| balance-alb      | 75                     | 75                          |

I notice that the first packet seems to have a lot less information, and then it's the stuff after that that usually hits near 100 mbit/s in speed.

(I also ran a quick check with iperf to make sure that both interfaces actually worked, which they did, they both worked and got 70 mbit/s of bandwidth.).

Round robin works by just rotating which interface gets the next packet. According to the internet, it can result in packets arriving out of order, which can lead to slower speeds than a single nic in some cases. I can't find any posts on this that are newer than 3 years old, so I don't know if it applies, but I wanted to avoid round robin for that reason.

People say the best mode is LACP, but I don't get any performance improvement — however, according to [Red Hat's documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/configuring-network-bonding_configuring-and-managing-networking#configuring-a-network-bond-by-using-nmcli_configuring-network-bonding), this mode does seem to require some configuration on the side of the network switch. Perhaps without that configuration can still _do_ a bond and combine two interfaces into one, but you don't get any performance out of it?

But when I run iperf on each of the physical interfaces simeuataneously, perhaps there is some kind of cap? Maybe the "two" ethernet interfaces in the wall are actually only one? But then why does round robin have consistent, better performance, over the theoretical 100 mbit/s limit? 

I think it is the former issue:

```

Much of the information has been ommitted for brevity, but it seems that if your switch doesn't support/isn't configured, then the "Aggregator ID" will be different when it's supposed to be the same, meaning only one ethernet interface is actually getting used. 

Instead of LACP, I set up loadbalancer-alb and use `ifstat` to moniter network traffic:

Nice! When running two `iperf` tests at once, to two different servers, both are used at once, and I get double the network traffic! Both iperf tests report 80 mbit/s. 


Then, I convert this bond to a bridge using cockpit. And the process of attempting to do so, the machine goes offline. It's possible that you cannot convert a bond to the special bridge that also acts as a normal ethernet at the same time, or maybe you cannot use a bond as a bridge at all. 

No, it does work. It's just that the address was reasigned via dhcp, but I wasn't sshing into the right port (I use port 22022 rather than the default 22). 

And then: `nmcli con add type veth ifname veth1 con-name veth1 veth.peer eth1`

And then disable both from cockpit, but add veth1 as a port to the main bridge.

Then, eth1 can be used as a bridge for incus.

`incus network create public0 bridge.external_interfaces=eth1 ipv4.address=none ipv4.dhcp=false ipv6.address=none ipv6.dhcp=false`

And then it works. 

It's brought up to me by a friend, that there is a possibility that the limitation of speeds is not on my side, either the NIC or the cable, but instead on CSUN's side, a 100 mbit/s limitation per _mac address_.

I test this by running three speedtests simultaneously, two on the side of CSUN's internet, and one within a virtual machine that has it's own Mac address. But the test only gets 200 mbit/s total from every device. 

However, there is a real possibility I am using the wrong cables, and it's the cables that are limiting. I will test


# Incus Configuration

Firstly, I don't want the "default" profile. It forces the `incusbr0` network on virtual machines, whereas I want users to be able to select an for which network they want — either a public network or an internal network.

A big thing I want is for the layer8 project to have it's own seperate set of networks and firewall rules, but still be able to have access to the `public0` network I have created, so people can create public virtual machines.

From `incus project edit layer8`:

```{.yaml}
config:
  features.images: "false"
  features.networks: "false"
  features.networks.zones: "true"
  features.profiles: "true"
  features.storage.buckets: "true"
  features.storage.volumes: "false"
  restricted: "true"
  restricted.networks.access: public0, internal0
description: ""
name: layer8
used_by:
- /1.0/profiles/default?project=layer8
```

There is no network named internal0 — instead I add one in after I create the project. With this, they would be limited to a single internal network, and public network.

## Authorization

`incus config trust add-certificate --projects layer8 --restricted layer8.crt`

`incus config trust add --projects layer8 --restricted layer8.crt`

And with this, my instance is restricted. 

Mostly. Storage pools and storage doesn't seem to work at all. 

So I create another storage pool called "layer8" from the UI. But this fails, and doesn't seem to be accessible from the layer8 project. 

I play around with it more, but I think what I need to do is write an "authorization scriptlet" that explicitly gives access for the layer8 storage pool to those users. 

The language used in these "scriptlets" is Starlark... which is not documented on the actual [authorization scriptlet](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/#authorization-scriptlet) section. Thankfully, there is another [instance placement scriptlet](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/explanation/clustering/#instance-placement-scriptlet), which talks about the language and parameters taken, and how to actually use and set the scriptlet. 

Of course, this is still pretty unclear. What is an object? [Incus has auto generated api documentation](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/main/doc/rest-api.yaml), including on what I am assuming is an "object", [StoragePools](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/main/doc/rest-api.yaml#L6295).

So I need a scriptlet that allows the Layer 8 Certificate, to access storage pool objects named

If if I have to do this anyways, what was the point of trying to avoid the openid + openfga (I would have to write code) setup?!

So here is my attempt at a scriplet that allows all access:

```{.python filename='allowall.star'}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  return True
```

`cat allowall.star | incus config set authorization.scriptlet=-`

And it works! The Layer 8 Certificate can get access to all resources. 

Now let's try to do it for real:

```{.python filename='auth.star'}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "025a3516ca2c":
    if object.name == "layer8":
      return True
  else:
    return False
```

Okay. And now nothing has access to anything. It seems that these scriptlets happen _before_ the authorizations happen, and not after. Meaning that you have to actually write scriptlets to do something 


```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "96bd207fe6a1":
    return True
  if details.Username == "025a3516ca2c":
    if details.IsAllProjectsRequest:
      return False
    if details.ProjectName == "layer8":
      return True
    if object.name == "layer8":
      return True
  else:
    return False
```

At first I get an error:

`Failed to run: string has no .name field or method`

So it seems that object doesn't actually have an atribute named anything. I can't seem to find any documentation on this.

```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "96bd207fe6a1":
    return True
  if details.Username == "025a3516ca2c":
    if details.IsAllProjectsRequest:
      return False
    if details.ProjectName == "layer8":
      return True
    if object.name == "layer8":
      return True
  else:
    return False
```

And now the incus server hangs... Super annoying.


```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "96bd207fe6a1":
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Okay, and this fails. At this point. I also tried logging, which only seems to work if it's a warning, and not an info level log. 

```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  log_warn(details.Username)
  log_warn(object)
  return True
```

and:

```{.default}
(clipped for brevity) server:incus"
(clipped for brevity) horization scriptlet: 96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe5647c61791db2"
(clipped for brevity) horization scriptlet: server:incus"
```

It seems that the certificate that is used, is not the clipped version listed by `incus config trust list`

```
root@thoth:~# incus config trust list
+--------------+--------+-------------+--------------+----------------------+
|     NAME     |  TYPE  | DESCRIPTION | FINGERPRINT  |     EXPIRY DATE      |
+--------------+--------+-------------+--------------+----------------------+

+--------------+--------+-------------+--------------+----------------------+
```

But, I did figure out how storage pool is getting referred to:

```{.default}
orization scriptlet: 96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe5647c61791db2"
orization scriptlet: storage_pool:layer8"
```

So I think the entire "object" is actually just a string. But it's named object?!

I [found the code, though](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/332ad420f963779f03f1eb25d9725372ac946fa9/internal/server/scriptlet/auth/auth.go#L17). And it seems like "object", is in fact a string. 

`func AuthorizationRun(l logger.Logger, details *common.RequestDetails, object string, entitlement string) (bool, error) {`



```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  log_warn(details)
  log_warn(object)
  log_warn(entitlement)
  return True
```

`journalctl -xeu incus`

```{.default}
horization scriptlet: {\"Username\": \"96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe56>
horization scriptlet: storage_pool:layer8"
horization scriptlet: can_edit"
horization scriptlet: {\"Username\": \"96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe56>
horization scriptlet: server:incus"
horization scriptlet: can_view_resources"
horization scriptlet: {\"Username\": \"96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff4312
```

With this, I can design an authorization function that actually works. 

Also:

```{.default}
root@thoth:~# incus config trust show 96bd207fe6a1
name: incus-ui.crt
type: client
restricted: false
fingerprint: 96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe5647c61791db2
```

By asking to show me information about the short version of the certificate, I can get the full version.


```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe5647c61791db2":
    return True
  if details.Username == "025a3516ca2c622a93446548954e33d75eafa3e8173d0d6a435fc27d4072932e":
    if details.ProjectName == "layer8":
      return True
    if object == "storage_pool:layer8":
      return True
    if details.IsAllProjectsRequest == True:
      return False
  else:
    return False
```

But this doesn't work. It seems that the server api itself, and projects, are objects that are controlled by access control. I have to allow access.

```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe5647c61791db2":
    return True
  if details.Username == "025a3516ca2c622a93446548954e33d75eafa3e8173d0d6a435fc27d4072932e":
    if details.IsAllProjectsRequest == True:
      return False
    if object == "project:layer8":
      if entitlement == "can_view":
        return True
    if details.ProjectName == "layer8":
      return True
    if details.ProjectName == "default":
      if entitlement == "can_view_resources":
        return True
    if object == "storage_pool:layer8":
      return True
    if object == "server:incus":
      if entitlement == "can_view_sensitive":
        return True
      if entitlement == "can_view":
        return True
  else:
    return False
```

After this I do some testing, and it mostly works — except the Layer 8 certificate has access to the `default` storage pool, including being able to upload isos, which is not what I want. But, if I remove the `can_view_resources` bit, then the Layer 8 Certificate cannot see the disk space used in that storage pool — which I may not want. 

I also may need to give access to the objects `"profile:layer8/default"`, since that seems to exist in the `default` project.

So I asked on the creators youtube stream, if there is any way to associate a storage pool to a project, for a restricted certificate. 

He says that you can set a limit of 0 for the disk space of a storage pool, for a project, and then that project won't be able to access that storage pool. I don't like this solution, as I want my authorization logic to be deny by default, and explicitly allow access to certain resources. However, it does give me an idea:

What if I deny access to storage pools not named layer8? Well, I would first have to filter for an object, a string that starts with "storage_pool:"

```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe5647c61791db2":
    return True
  if details.Username == "025a3516ca2c622a93446548954e33d75eafa3e8173d0d6a435fc27d4072932e":
    if object.startswith("storage_pool:"):
      if object != "storage_pool:layer8":
        return False
      return True
    if details.IsAllProjectsRequest == True:
      return False
    if object == "project:layer8":
      if entitlement == "can_view":
        return True 
    if details.ProjectName == "layer8":
      return True
    if details.ProjectName == "default":
      if entitlement == "can_view_resources":
        return True
    if object == "server:incus":
      if entitlement == "can_view":
        return True
      if entitlement == "can_view_resources":
        return True
  else:
    return False
```

This still doesn't restrict the Layer 8 certificate from uploading to the default storage pool. Actually now, Incus seems to crash/freeze, and I have to restart the systemd service in order to get back. 

Okay. At this point, attempting to upload an ISO crashes Incus (testing with the allow all log script). The API won't load, and the command line just hangs as well. Systemd logs don't say anything, so I'm stuck. I can restart Incus, but this changes testing my authorization scriptlets from annoying to painful. 

I'm going to update the website this, and make a post in the Incus forum. 

Post: <https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/authorization-scriptlet-how-to-allow-a-restricted-certificate-to-access-a-single-storage-pool/23497/2>

But I need a solution now, pretty much. 

```{.python}
def authorize(details, object, entitlement):
  if details.Username == "96bd207fe6a1b5ca48284f012e036fff43126870c52949479fe5647c61791db2":
    return True
  if details.Username == "025a3516ca2c622a93446548954e33d75eafa3e8173d0d6a435fc27d4072932e":
    if object.startswith("storage_pool:"):
      if object != "storage_pool:layer8":
        return False
      return True
    if details.IsAllProjectsRequest == True:
      return False
    if object == "project:layer8":
      if entitlement == "can_view":
        return True 
    if object == "profile:layer8/default":
      return True
    if details.ProjectName == "layer8":
      return True
    if details.ProjectName == "default":
      if entitlement == "can_view_resources":
        return True
    if object == "server:incus":
      if entitlement == "can_view":
        return True
      if entitlement == "can_view_resources":
        return True
  else:
    return False
```

This, plus:

`incus project set layer8 limits.disk.pool.default=0`

are what I ending up using. 

Okay. It doesn't work the way I want. But I'm close enough, so I guess I'll just roll with it instead.

Okay, breaking change update: <https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/incus-0-5-1-has-been-released/18848>

Now, people with Red Hat based distros (Alma, Rocky, Centos, etc), have to do something a little extra to get them to work. It didn't work for me initially, until I enabled networking by default. 

# Kubernetes (Again)

Next up is the rest of the services I want to host. I still want to do a Kubernetes cluster, with everything GitOps though, but having Incus opens up another oppurtunity: I could do a multi node Kubernetes cluster, in virtual machines, instead of a single node. 

I know I still want SSO, and I actually want SSO for Incus as well. After watching looking at openfga, it doesn't seem to be nightmarishly hard. I think I will do a one node kubernetes cluster, again with openebs, reusing that same flux config. But this time, the deployment will be done in a virtual machine, where I can snapshot the entire virtual machine, feed it the gpu, or the extra hard drive I have. '

Nah. I think I'm just gonna deploy bare metal. 

Disable RKE2 ingress-nginx:

```{.yaml filename='/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml'}
disable:
  # Yeah so apparently this was kind of important. 
  # - rke2-coredns
  - rke2-ingress-nginx
```

And then enable servicelb, to allow for the ingress service to actually serve on a port on the host:

`systemctl edit rke2-server.service`

```
### Editing /etc/systemd/system/rke2-server.service.d/override.conf
### Anything between here and the comment below will become the new contents of the file

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rke2 server --enable-servicelb
```

Fix NetworkManager: <https://docs.rke2.io/known_issues#networkmanager>

And then RKE2 is set up. 


Flux:

```{.default}

flux bootstrap git --url ssh://moonpie@moonpiedumpl.ing:22022/home/moonpie/flux-config --branch=main --private-key-file=/home/moonpie/.ssh/moonstack --verbose

cat age.agekey | kubectl create secret generic sops-age --namespace flux-system --from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin

```

But none of this works, because for whatever reason, the remote git repo on my server does not have any commits, even after I push the git repo. 

`git push origin origin/main`

Can I change this to be the default? But my stuff deploys at least. Authentik is up again. 

## Coder

[coder](https://coder.com/) is an open source platform for remote desktop environments. The thing they seem to be most excited about is the VScode based environemnts, but I care the most about the terminal access, and the webvnc based environments.

Also, looking at their [helm chart values](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/helm/coder/values.yaml), and their [OIDC documentation](https://coder.com/docs/admin/users/oidc-auth) it seems that environment variables are used to configure many aspects of coder. 

So, I need to set up secrets again.

`sops --encrypt --encrypted-regex '^(values.yaml)$' codersecrets.yaml`

To get secret content after it is applied, for testing:

`kubectl get secret secret -n namespace -o jsonpath="{.data.values\.yaml}" | base64 -d`

One hiccup: I fear taht I may need to set a list of valid email domains that it accepts as OIDC users, [documented here](https://coder.com/docs/admin/users/oidc-auth#step-2-configure-coder-with-the-openid-connect-credentials). 

But looking [through the code](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/4587082fcf84a92bda6413733371373acae2392f/coderd/userauth.go#L1357), it looks like I can leave that config empty. 

So here are my two secrets, that I am encrypting (without the sensitive data, of course):

```{.yaml}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: coder-pg-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  values.yaml: |
    auth:
      username: coder
      password: "secretpassword"
      database: coder
```

```{.yaml}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: coder-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  values.yaml: | 
    coder:
      env:
        - name: CODER_PG_CONNECTION_URL
          value: "postgres://coder:secretpassword@coder-db-postgresql.coder.svc.cluster.local:5432/coder?sslmode=disable"
        - name: CODER_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
          value: "OIDC Secret value here"
```

`sops --encrypt --encrypted-regex '^(values.yaml)$' --in-place filename.yaml`

Whoops, this doesn't deploy.

`kubectl create namespace coder`

It mostly worked, but I encountered an error:

```
Encountered an error running "coder server", see "coder server --help" for more information
error: access-url must include a scheme (e.g. 'http://' or 'https://)
```

So I had to change that variable. 

One thing I decided to do is store the terraform configuration files in my git repo. They won't be applied automatically, 


But eventually, I got it deployed. I even set up a workspace, using the starter "kubernetes" template.

It doesn't come with noVNC, which I really want. I'm looking at adapting the code from the [desktop container](https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates/blob/main/desktop-container/main.tf) in combination with [the Kali Linux webtop image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-kali-linux/) to get a web based Kali Linux environmet for CTF's, workshops, and similar events. 

Okay, this is actually kinda difficult. 

`s6-overlay-suexec: fatal: can only run as pid 1`

So the webtop docker containers work by launching a complex set of init scripts using s6, and if I try to start s6 via the `/init` script in a shell, then it complains about not being pid one. I might have to create a custom container to get around this, but I don't want to do that. 

Another thing I can try is creating a ["docker mod"](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-and-maintaining-a-docker-mod), an extension to Linuxserver's docker containers that can be called via an environment variable. [Usage example here](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-webtop/#native-apps)

I could also try the [enterprise-desktop](https://hub.docker.com/r/codercom/enterprise-desktop/tags) image by Coder themselves, but I really do want that kasmvnc and kali image. 

Although, it looks like I don't have time, since I need an emphermal desktop UI up now, for the lab. The [coder templates repo has a "better vnc" image](https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates/blob/main/better-vnc/main.tf), which is a kasmvnc based image. But, there is no prebuild docker image for me to work with. I tried to replace the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates/blob/main/better-vnc/build/Dockerfile) image with kasmweb's docker image: `docker.io/kasmweb/kali-rolling-desktop:1.17.0`. But it didn't work. 

Instead, I built that image, and pushed it to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/moonpiedumplings/coder/tags).

I play around with the image, and the terraform code, but when I try to deploy it, I get an error. It's unclear, but I think the problem is that the kasmweb images I used, is designed for docker, so when I try to deploy it on kubernetes, things break.


What about something else: With the Linuxserver images, what if I run a second command in the container. It looks like kubernetes can do this via [container lifecycle hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/). I can also reuse these in the [terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs/resources/deployment#nestedblock--spec--template--spec--container--l).

This seemed interesting, and after some tinkering with security contexts (I think s6 init wants to start as root), I almost have it working but code-server has an error:

`/tmp/code-server/bin/code-server: exec: line 28: /tmp/code-server/lib/code-server-4.8.3/lib/node: not found`

Sometimes the persistent volume claim that Coder would createw ould fail to delete, becuse the container wasn't getting deleted. To fix, I had to shell into the container, and then `pkill coder`, to destroy the zombie process.

But, after using the normal code-server install script, which installs a debian package into the system it works. But, after much tinkering, I've found that I don't actually need code-server right now, so I got rid of it. 

The important thing is the coder agent. This agent seems to not properly die, which somewhat makes sense, because I start it via a [container lifecycle poststart hook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks) having it be an actual command. 

The problem is that even though the container dies properly if I exec in and kill the coder process (or PID 1), it doesn't work if I have these commands as a lifecycle hook.

I also discovered that "coder.agent.main.startup_script" and "coder.agent.main.init_script" are different. Init script is what downloads and starts the actual coder agent, whereas the startup script is just auxilliary stuff you want to run, like downloading and starting code-server.

So I need a way to start the init script, such that it detatches and disowns itself and then the kubernetes contanier considers itself as running. After some tinkering, I got this:

`command = ["screen", "-dmS", "coder_screen", "sh", "-c", coder_agent.main.init_script]`

Because the container comes with screen already, I can do this, and reuse an existing container for coder with minimal modifications or changes to the terraform overall (other options I were looking into were things like using a volume mount to add more s6 services, but it is difficult because the init_script is autogenerated, so I don't actaully know what it is, and I also still do not know if it is a shell script or just a sequence of commands set up by EOF). 

In the future, when I have more users, another thing I want to do is apply NetworkPolicies depending on the groups a user is, to control which networks that the workspace has access to. 

I have made a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/moonpiedumplings/641be9c7662fa10174fe9845a183c073) with my code. 


Next up is to inject the environment variables via secrets. 

It took some tinkering but I got it working in the repo. Apparently, the postgres process doesn't actually need the secret url I gave it, so I got rid of it.

Also, apparently when coder does a release upgrade, it deletes all it's data, and asks for a new admin account. Since I want to auto update coder, I wonder if I can GitOps the entire configuration?



### Oauth2

Another thing is that Oauth2/OIDC was not working. It seems that my method of secrets did not work, so instead I have to do something else, probably "envfrom".

<https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/coder-v2/coder>

<https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/helm/coder/values.yaml#L31>

In addition to this, I also set CODER_PG_CONNECTION_URL. It seems that I wasn't setting that, which caused me to lose all user data upon upgrades.



## Authentik

It's deployed (see [previous project](../build-server-5/)), but I am going to record my steps here. Firstly, it looks like I should configure from the "Application" page, and use "Create with Provider" in order to create the whole set of necessary things. 

There were some interesting hiccups though. The "Issuer url" for Coder should have a backslash, it seems to use strict string matching.

```
error: create oidc config: configure oidc provider: oidc: issuer did not match the issuer returned by provider, expected "https://sso.moonpiedumpl.ing/application/o/coder" got "https://sso.moonpiedumpl.ing/application/o/coder/"
```

Also, for Incus, it looks like I need to enable [device code](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/add-secure-apps/providers/oauth2/device_code), otherwise it won't work. 

I'm now stuck for Incus, because it seems that single sign on only works if the services are on the same domain/subdomain. Incus is on a different domain, so it fails. I need to proxy a service external to Kubernetes, to something inside Kubernetes. 

This is actually more difficult than I thought it would be. 

```{.yaml}
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: incus
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
  namespace: openfga
spec:
  rules:
  - host: incus.moonpiedumpl.ing
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/"
        backend:
          service:
            name: incus-external-svc
            port: 
              number: 8443
  tls:
  - hosts: 
    - "incus.moonpiedumpl.ing"
    secretName: incus-tls
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: incus-external-svc
  namespace: openfga
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8443
      targetPort: 8443
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: incus-external-svc
  namespace: openfga
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 130.166.79.34
    ports:
      - port: 8443
```

So this works, but it doesn't get an SSL certificate. It just uses the default kubernetes test certificate, rather than  a real one. To fix this, you have to remove these two annotations:

```
acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
```

Before readding them. But don't letsencrypt only last 90 days? But this works, however.

Next thing is, I want to automatically create projects in Incus when users are invited, so people can have a private (publicly hosted) VPS for whatever they want.

Right now, the most reasonable way to do this is to do a "stage" with an "expression policy", which can execute arbitrary python code, and then I can make a API call with the python request library (using my private admin certificate). 

[Here are the Incus API docs on how to add a project](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/rest-api-spec/#/projects/projects_post).  [Here are the docs on how to bind an expression policy to a stage](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/customize/policies/working_with_policies#bind-a-policy-to-a-stage). 


Okay apparently requests needs to read a certificate file in order to do TLS auth, and I don't have one. I can probably get around this by creating a tempfile or something of the sort.

I may also need to make a python request to openfga... hmmm. I think this might be too complex. Firstly, let's figure out what actually needs to be done:

* User does invite
* Create incus project named after user (via api call, that passes uses a tls certificate to authenticate)
* Add user to created project in openfga. I think this is giving a user either the operator or user relation to a project.

According to one of the [test suites](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/1f61d85b164cdfd33600e7ce3b13154feea54de5/test/suites/openfga.sh#L273), it looks like the "user" of a project can interact with instances, but not edit them, whereas an [operator has control over project level resources](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/1f61d85b164cdfd33600e7ce3b13154feea54de5/test/suites/openfga.sh#L185) (but maybe is restricted by project restrictions.)

```{.python}
import tempfile
import json

ca_cert = ""

# Compressed backups?

incusdata = {
    "config": {
        "features.networks": "false",
        "features.profiles": "true",
        "restricted": {
          "backups": "allow",
          "networks.access": "public0, incus0"
        }
    }, 
    "description": "Personal project for you", 
    "name": request.user
}

# Write the certificate to a temporary file since this will be ran inside authentik
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False) as tmp:
    tmp.write(ca_cert)
    tmp.flush()
    response = requests.post('incus.moonpiedumpl.ing',json=data, verify=tmp.name)


openfga_api_key = ""

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {openfga_api_key}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}


openfgadata = {
  "authorization_model_id": "stuff",  
  "tuple_key": {
        "user": f"user:{requests.user}",
        "relation": "member",
        "object": "layer8"
    }
}

openfgaresponse = requests.post('openfga.moonpiedumpl.ing/stores/$FGA_STORE_ID/check', json=openfgadata, headers=headers)

return true

```

I will have to collect some information, on the authorization model id, and the store id. 

Okay, I won't sweat a custom project yet. But I will automatically add invited users to the layer8 group.

Creating an invite was pretty painful. There appear to be steps required, but not documented on the [invitation documentation page](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/users-sources/user/invitations), where you also have to bind an "invitation" stage as the first stage in the actual invite flow. Otherwise things don't work. 


But after some tinkering, and giving up on an expression policy that affects both Incus and openfga, and focusing on openfga instead, I got something that works:

```{.python}
import json

openfga_api_key = "secretkey"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {openfga_api_key}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}



data = {
    "writes": {
        "tuple_keys": [
            {
                "user": f"user:{request.user.username}",
                "relation": "member",
                "object": "group:layer8"
            }
        ]
    },
    "authorization_model_id": "01JWHN0RS0QTJ4JJPJ659XCSPG"
}

openfgaresponse = requests.post('https://openfga.moonpiedumpl.ing/stores/01JWHMZPF85VE8DWYHKV90QTCT/write', data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)

print(openfgaresponse)

return True
```

With this, users can sign up, and then they automatically get added as a "member" to the openfga object. Then they can log in via SSO to incus, and they have access to the layer8 project. 

People have complimented me, saying that this setup is much, much easier to use than the previous setup, in which people had to import certificates.

### Postgres update

So my authentik goes down, because I need to manually backup and restore the postgres database in order for an update to happen.

<https://version-2023-10.goauthentik.io/docs/troubleshooting/postgres/upgrade_kubernetes>

Except, since postgres updated automatically, it was crashing because it couldn't launch with oldder database files. Firstly, I edited the pod and downgraded postgres. 

But I got an ImagePullBackOff error, so I firstly [listed all images running in the cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/list-all-running-container-images/), before seleccting the postgres image that was already there. 

I have to get the secret myself:

`cat /opt/bitnami/postgresql/secrets/postgres-password`


It still says password authentication failed, but it does dump the file out. 


I end with `mv data data-15`.

```
[moonpie@osiris ~]$ flux resume source git flux-system
[moonpie@osiris ~]$ flux reconcile helmrelease -n authentik authentik
```

But then I still can't do things because I'm not root. 

```
 resources: {}
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
      privileged: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      # runAsGroup: 1001
      runAsNonRoot: false
      # runAsUser: 1001
```

So I edit the pod with that. Doesn't work, apparently only a few things can be changed. 

I follow [this stackoverflow answer](), and come up with this:


`root@thoth:/var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin# ./runc --root /run/containerd/runc/k8s.io/ exec -t -u 0 f2aedf564b6f43fc895fc84aeba2e7e7a02b4f59ea835de13b76bcade462adca bash`

I'm root indeed, but I still am struggling to connect to the postgres server, and it is asking for a password. Actually, I can give it one — but my password contains special characters, making it difficult to enter manually. I can change the password, and then. 

I encode special characters in the url, but it doesn't work:

`I have no name!@authentik-postgresql-0:/bitnami/postgresql$ psql 'postgresql://postgres:secretpassword/@localhost/'
psql: error: local user with ID 1001 does not exist`


I could nuke authentik and reset it, but instaed, I think I am going to change the secret authentik uses for the password, while downgrading postgres at the same time. 

So firstly I need to edit the sops file: 

`export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/vscode/flux-config/age.agekey`

`sops edit --ignore-mac secrets.yaml` --ignore-mac is needed because sops thinks the file has been tampered with. 


But even after editing the file, it still asks for a password, and it doesn't work.

```{.default filename='/opt'}
I have no name!@authentik-postgresql-0:/opt/bitnami/postgresql/conf$ cat pg_hba.conf
host     all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
host     all             all             ::/0                    md5
local    all             all                                     md5
host     all             all        127.0.0.1/32                 md5
host     all             all        ::1/128                      md5
```

The container doesn't come with an editor. :/

Trying something else, there is a docker container, [pgautoupgrade](https://github.com/pgautoupgrade/docker-pgautoupgrade) to automatically upgrade a database. 

Firstly, I located the persistent volume in "/var/openebs" on the system. Then I ran the command:

`root@thoth:/var/openebs/persistent/pvc-513c6021-afbb-410c-9c86-60fcf9d6089c# podman run -it -v "./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secretpassword -e PGAUTO_ONESHOT=yes docker.io/pgautoupgrade/pgautoupgrade:17-bookworm`

The update works!

But authentik still fails to access postgres via the password. The logs for both simply say that password authentiation failed. 

I also try some debug pods:

```
kubectl debug -n authentik authentik-server-5dcc9c45f5-thllc -it --image=busybox --target=server
kubectl debug -n authentik authentik-postgresql-0 -it --image=busybox --target=postgresql
```

Interesting and useful feature, but not helpful at the moment. `:(`

The Bitnami postgresql chart, used here, seems to have something to [automatically update to the new passwords](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql#automated-update-using-a-password-update-job), but it requires the old passwords. 

`mv pg_hba.conf pg_hba.conf.bac`

`echo "local    all             all                                     trust" > pga.conf` (No text editor, and these config files don't seem to be mounted.)

`/opt/bitnami/postgresql/bin/pg_ctl reload`

Then I can get in. Now I have to change the password manually.

`psql -U postgres`

And then:

```
postgres=# ALTER USER authentik WITH PASSWORD 'secretpassword';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=# ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'secretpassword';
ALTER ROLE
postgres=#
```

Then I put the original `pg_hba.conf` back, and run `pg_ctl reload`. 

And it works!

## Openfga

Okay, I deployed it using the helm chart. I'm lookiing through the [Incus docs](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/#open-fine-grained-authorization-openfga). So it looks like Incus does the intial setup. 

Then, once I do that, I need to [call the API to update relations](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/update-tuples). 


Also, I need to add a nodeport service so that Incus can access the server. After scrolling through [a very interesting security audit](https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/assessments/projects/openfga/joint-assessment/):

> The likelihood is rated low as OpenFGA is designed to be run within an intranet environment and not exposed to public internet.

And this is somewhat difficult with my setup. I deployed it on Kubernetes, with no firewall, and now I want to expose the service — but only to localhost. 

Actually that also doesn't work. It looks like coder instances are placed on the same ip address as my host machine, meaning they would have access to all network stuff that localhost would. 

No, looking further, it does look like openfga does use authentication, and the reason why an intranet is recommended is in case of ddos attacks. 

Here is my secret:

```{.yaml}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  values.yaml: |
    postgresql:
      auth:
        postgresPassword: secretpassword
    datastore:
      uri: "postgres://postgres:secretpassword@openfga-postgresql.default.svc.cluster.local:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
    authn:
      preshared:
        keys: ["secretkeyhere"]
```

Now that I've deployed it, I need to configure it. 

Firstly, to get my preshared key:

`kubectl get secrets -n openfga openfga-secrets -o jsonpath='{.data.values\.yaml}' | base64 -d`

(I actually managed to remember this without looking at my notes. I don't know if I should be proud or scared).


`nix-shell -p openfga-cli`,  or other methods of installing the openfga cli.

[Configuration docs](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/cli)

`export FGA_API_URL=https://openfga.moonpiedumpl.ing`

`export FGA_API_TOKEN=secretkeyhere`

`fga create store incus` — only needs to be done once.

```{.default}
[nix-shell:~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io]$ fga store list
{
  "continuation_token":"",
  "stores": [
    {
      "created_at":"2025-05-30T22:28:45.160445043Z",
      "id":"01JWHMZPF85VE8DWYHKV90QTCT",
      "name":"incus",
      "updated_at":"2025-05-30T22:28:45.160445043Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

`export FGA_STORE_ID=01JWHMZPF85VE8DWYHKV90QTCT`

`export FGA_MODEL_ID=01JWHN0RS0QTJ4JJPJ659XCSPG`


And then, I fill out the incus configuration values: openfga.api.token, openfga.api.url, and openfga.store.id with the appropriate values. 

After this, running this command: `fga model get --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID` outputs the [incus openfga model](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/authorization/#openfga-model). 


```{.default}
[nix-shell:~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io]$ fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID group:layer8#member operator project:layer8
{
  "successful": [
    {
      "object":"project:layer8",
      "relation":"operator",
      "user":"group:layer8#member"
    }
  ]
}
[nix-shell:~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io]$ fga query check --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID --model-id=$FGA_MODEL_ID group:layer8#member operator project:layer8
{
  "allowed":true,
  "resolution":""
}
```

Neat!

But this doesn't actually work. I attempt to sign on with single sign on, and it takes me back to the Incus logged out page, and the only information is a vague errorr: `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource. `

I get a little more information when I authenticate with the command line: 

```{.default}

This is also vague, but something interesting shows up in the journald logs:

```
Jun 02 23:15:34 thoth incusd[1286]: time="2025-06-02T23:15:34-07:00" level=warning msg="Rejecting request from untrusted client" ip="130.166.192.112:12998"
```

I found the [error in the source code](https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/5efa7d369e6cf74f452ff5b298bc4687d2da66ae/cmd/incusd/daemon.go#L703), but I don't quite understand what's going on.

After finding some [discussion posts](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/need-help-incus-oidc-with-zitadel/19812/4), I changed the oidc claim from `preferred_username` to `email`, and it works ­— kinda. It only works if I login and launch the web ui via the incus command line client (website still gets that error), and when I do so, I don't have access to anything at all.

Also, incus seems to have an error in the logs, related to openfga:

```

```

`fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID group:layer8#member user server:incus`

Still no dice. What about the admin role?  

`fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID group:layer8#member admin server:incus`

I also tried:

`fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID user:testuser admin server:incus`, and variants including `test@gmail.com` (email address of my testuers). 

Still doesn't work, but I did learn something. It seems that openfga is not reading groups from ldap/oidc to figure out what groups users are in, but instead it has it's own groups, that I have to add users to, as a relation.


Also, I switched the oidc claim back to `preferred_username`, instead of `email`, and it does show up as a different `user:username` in the openfga logs, instead of `user:email`. 

Wait, that's not true: If the user has server:admin permissions, then they can change server settings, even though they can't see any instances or projects.

And if I give the user the operator relation to the layer8 project, then it can see only two of the 9 existing vitual machines `:(` 

I have two theories:

1. This is something to do with accessing certain networks, specifically the `public0` network I have, and the `default` disk pool. These aren't considered under the "layer8" project, so they aren't able to be accessed by the machine. It could also be the images, that are considered under project "default" and not 

2. The Openfga relations are broken and need to be rebuilt. 

Something else: Why am I trying to figure it out? It seems like sso users can access, view, create, and delete stuff, just not everything that is already there. 

```
[nix-shell:~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io]$ fga tuple write --store-id=$FGA_STORE_ID project:layer8 project profile:layer8/default
```

This enables my test user to see the layer8 default profile, but I really think this is the kind of relationship that should have been automatically added. And upon further searching, it seems that the two instances I care about, already are explicitly under the layer8 certificate.

```{.default}
~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io> fga tuple write --store-id=01JWHMZPF85VE8DWYHKV90QTCT project:layer8 project instance:layer8/*

~/vscode/moonpiedumplings.github.io> fga tuple write --store-id=01JWHMZPF85VE8DWYHKV90QTCT project:layer8 project instance:layer8/Kal-Test
```

Sadly, the former doesn't work, but the latter does. Also, it seems that when I move instances from one project to another, the openfga relations are created, allowing me to access stuff.

`incus move --target-project default --project layer8 Kal-Test` (the Instance must be stopped). 

After creating a new storage pool, I see the relation that is missing:

```{.default}
      "key": {
        "object":"storage_pool:testpool",
        "relation":"server",
        "user":"server:incus"
      },
      "timestamp":"2025-06-16T23:29:34.933052608Z"
```

Adding this relation to the other storage pools, and then it works. 

Next up is networks, which do not load. 

I tried:

```
[nix-shell:~]$ fga tuple write --store-id=01K001MQRKQ1BH74FZP9H1V89X server:incus server project:layer8
```

This doesn't work, but is probably needed anyways so I am keeping it here.

```
[nix-shell:~]$ fga tuple write --store-id=01K001MQRKQ1BH74FZP9H1V89X project:layer8 project network:default/internal0
```

Now it works, and people with access to the layer8 network can access this subnet. Although this kind of control seems to be redundant with the way that projects have a built in way to restrict what networks they use.

Finally, I also need to control storage pools. 

```{.json}
 {
      "key": {
        "object":"storage_volume:layer8/layer8/virtual-machine/vmname",
        "relation":"project",
        "user":"project:layer8"
      },
      "timestamp":"2025-07-12T19:27:48.422892604Z"
    },
```

But this one was automatically added. Maybe Incus automatically syncs resources, and I don't need to do it manually, I just need to wait?


Oh, and another issue I had is that after I rebooted my machine, all my openfga relations where lost. I forgot to deploy the openfga connected to the postgres, so no actual data was being stored persistently. 

I also made the same mistake with coder earlier. In the future, I will delete my helmreleases and then redeploy them to ensure that the data is actually persistent. 

I nuked the setup and attempted to reset it up again, but I [ran into an issue](https://github.com/openfga/helm-charts/issues/211). I tried some of the fixes in that thread, but they did not work (probably because ArgoCD is different from Flux).

What worked was [a thread about flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/1085#discussioncomment-473271), where essentially the problem is that flux waits for pods to be created before running post install jobs. But, sometimes pods can have a pod that doesn't do anything but wait for the jobs to complete, so the waiting for the pods to be fully created must be disabled.

## Nextcloud

Before I deploy nextcloud I should probably format that 4 TB hard drive I have and make it accessible for stuff.

## Forgejo

Firstly, here are relevant links:

<https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/forgejo-helm/forgejo>

<https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo-helm/forgejo-helm/src/branch/main/values.yaml> — These are the actual values

<https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/config-cheat-sheet/> — and this is the forgeo cheat sheet, and all values in here can be set in the helm chart. 

So what needs to be done is mainly the oauth/oidc login.

* Disable built in accounts (sign up, and log in)
* Oauth login


Another thing I want to do is deploy [anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/admin/environments/kubernetes) to protect from scrapers. Due to the way that git forges seem to dynamically generate content, when scrapers attempt to scrape forges, there is a massive CPU load. A temporary workaround is I'm going to block viewing except for signed in users, but this will be a longer term solution.

To start, firstly it seemms like forgejo uses a syntax of [existingsecret](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/forgejo-helm/forgejo#oauth2-settings) to be able to easily add secret data to the helm configuration.

Another thing I want to deploy is [forgejo's built in actions](https://forgejo.org/2023-02-27-forgejo-actions/). However, [according to the docs](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/runner-installation/), it seems like actions are not ran in a virtual machine, like Github actions are. Instead they are ran in docker/podman/lxc containers, which is much, much weaker isolation from the host overall. 

After some thought, I think the best way to do this is to not deploy a runner initially, but instead to deploy a virtual machine on Incus and connect it layer on. The most theoretically way to do this, I think, is to set up the docker-in-docker image to use the kata-containers runtime instead of normal docker, so the docker jobs are actually being ran in VM's. I'm not really interested in a complex setup though, so I'll just get it up first.

Right now I'll just get forgejo up, but Incus provides Nixos images, and the [forgejo runner has a nixos config](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/runner-installation/#nixos). 


Things were mostly going smoothly, until I was playing with oauth. I think that forgejo supports three different things that get conflated when I try to search for them:

* Acting as an Oauth2 *client*
* Logins via OpenID
* Acting as an Oauth2 *provider*

I am going through the [forgejo docs](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/docs) right now (the website doesn't support search so I cloneed the git repo), and it appears that being an Oauth2 client is not really documented. OpenID is barely documented beyond a brief mention, it's only the Oauth2 provider that is extensively mentioned. 

But I know that forgejo supports more Ouath configuration options beyond [what the helm chart mentions](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo-helm/forgejo-helm/src/branch/main/values.yaml#L468) [like in this example](https://github.com/blackxored/homelab-legacy/blob/2fa182fb3d38022b19ca25bd35c8c44790689f95/kubernetes/apps/default/forgejo/app/helmrelease.yaml#L139)

I suspect this is because setting up an Oauth2 provider via the UI is trivial and self explanatory. But I am not using the UI, so I found the [relevant source code](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/src/branch/forgejo/cmd/admin_auth_oauth.go#L18), and it explains the options. 


The issue is the way I do secrets. I was copying the `existingSecret` syntax from the bitnami subcharts, but that does not work.  [Forgejo has two ways to do secrets](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo-helm/forgejo-helm#additional-_app-ini_-settings). I dislike both of them, because I am trying to amke as much of my infra public as possible, except for the keys themselves. But with redis, I am forced to have the `host` option, which includes a password, be encyrpted in it's entireity. 

Well, I could use variables, but those also add complexity. After some pondering, I think the best way to do it is to just have commented out versions that do not include the sensitive data.

So I map out all the options, fix some minor issues, and I think the forgejo pod fials to deploy because I have "hostport" set, which doesn't work if forgejo is doing a rootless deployment. 

To fix:

```{.yaml}
security:
  containerSecurityContext:
    sysctls:
    - name: net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start
      value: "0"
```

This doesn't work, because apparently it only affects the pod's network namespace, and not the host. 

Another way to do this is by using a nodeport or loadbalancer service, but the reason why I am not a fan of those is that due to klipper-lb, all connections to ssh that way would appear to have the ip address of my server machine, rather than the ip address of the user. 

I guess the best way to do this is to expose extra ports using ingress-nginx, and then use ingress-nginx to expose a tcp service. One problem is that the [method to expose tcp services](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/) is specific to ingress-nginx, and not general. 

```{.default}
│ init-app-ini An app.ini file already exists. To prevent overwriting secret keys, these settings are dropped and remain unchanged:                                                        │

│ init-app-ini   - oauth2.JWT_SECRET                                                                                                                                                       │
│ init-app-ini   - server.LFS_JWT_SECRET
```

Are these settings important enough for me to set manually? According to the docs they are 

Also, I think that the configuration settings are not changed to the default if you unset them in the helm settings, they stay what they are. So I must explicitly change them.

This error happened becasue the oauth "group mappings" where wrong. 




## LLM Stuff

I am currently looking into options. I want OIDC sign in, and RAG.

I see for frontend options:

* Openwebui
  * Non open source license, but it's only restricting the ability to change UI
  * Helm chart provided
* Librechat
* <https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm>
* <https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon>
* <https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica>
  * Designed as mainly an alternative to perplexity than a full chatgippity alternative
* <https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui>


For backend options:

* Ollama
  * [Potential Caveats](https://programming.dev/post/33898365/18112603)
* <https://github.com/Nexesenex/croco.cpp>
  * Fork of KoboldAI
* Llmariner
  * Okay, this seems to [require the Nvidia operator and an s3 compatible object store](https://llmariner.ai/docs/setup/install/single_cluster_onpremise/)
* <https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI>
  * This one is cool because it seems to let you select between multiple backends, like llama, exllama, and more
  * It also explicitly supports cpu only, intel, amd, and vulkan. Although not relevant to my usecase, this is very interesting. 





## Ingress-Nginx

Okay, I thought I was done configuring Ingress-Nginx, until I logged into my Authentik and saw that all the logins appeared to be coming from the IP address of my host machine rather than the actual client IP of people who are connecting. 

Fiddling with it a little, I found an issue relevant to my setup: <https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb/issues/31>

Another relevant discussion: <https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/discussions/2997#discussioncomment-1617536>

It turns that out klipper, the k3s inbuilt load balancer, does not forward the real client ips to services.  

So, the main way people get around this is [externaltrafficpolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip), which probably works fine for my usecase, but the problem is tha in th real world, it risks imbalanced load balancing, which is why I'm trying to figure out how to get around it. 

So I'm playing around with a few options:

* Externaltrafficpolicy
* Loadbalancer
  * Klipper doesn't wrk for reasons mentioned above
  * [Ingress-nginx docs confirm that MetalLB cannot reuse the host's ip address or one's assigned by dhcp](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/baremetal/#a-pure-software-solution-metallb). 
* Nodeport
  * It looks like [nodeport still doesn't preserve the original source ip address](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/baremetal/#source-ip-address), unless you set externaltrafficpolicy to local
* hostport (ingress-nginx helm chart option where it exposes a port instead)
* Hostnetwork.

And now TLS doesn't work, even if I switch back to load balancer.

First I'm trying hostport.

`Deployment in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Deployment: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field PodSpec.spec.template.spec.hostNetwork of type bool`

Okay. I've tried hostport, nodeport, and externaltrafficpolicy. They all have this issue where I cannot actually access the proxied services on the subdomain, but instead it just takes me to my blg instance I hosted (that I never set up ssl for). 

But, even after I switch back to the default setup, I am still encountering this issue. 

```
[moonpie@osiris flux-config]$ kubectl get service -A
NAMESPACE       NAME                                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)                      AGE
blog            blog-nginx                              LoadBalancer   10.43.227.101   130.166.79.34      80:31748/TCP,443:31264/TCP   65d
```

Much content ommited. But, it looks like my blog attempted to eat my main ingress ports.  Okay, it looks like Bitnami's nginx was creating a Loadbalancer service. I considered changing the ports it served on (there doesn't appear to be a built in option to disable the service), but I wanted to learn how to patch helm charts so I did something else. 

```{.yaml}
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: nginx
      reconcileStrategy: ChartVersion
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: nginx
      version: "18.3.1"
  postRenderers:
    - kustomize:
        patches:
          - target:
              kind: Service
              name: blog-nginx 
            patch: |-
              $patch: delete
              apiversion: v1
              kind: Service
              metadata:
                name: not-used
```

And with this, there is no more loadbalancer service created. 


Oh, and it turns out that coder also creates a loadbalancer service, but thankfully there is a build in option, to change it to ClusterIP, since the ingress coder creates still wants to look at the service.

And yeah. Now, wien I sign in to Authentik, the actual ip address of the users who log in shows up.

Next up is to enable port 22 for the deployment. In addition to this, I also had to change the deployment strategy, otherwise the pods would not recreate. 

```{.yaml}
postRenderers:
    - kustomize:
        patches:
          - patch: |
              - op:  add
                path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/ports/-
                value:
                  containerPort: 22
                  hostPort: 22
                  name: ssh
                  protocol: TCP
            target:
              kind: Deployment
              name: ingress-nginx-controller
  interval: 1m0s
  values:
    controller:
      updateStategy:
        type: rollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
          maxSurge: 100%
          maxUnavailable: 100%
```

The problem is that when I attempt to do a helm upgrade, one of the deployment pods will not be deleted. But, that pod binds ports. So because the pod is never deleted, the new pod can never be created (because I am on a single node). 

The other bit I added was opening port 22 so I can use a [tcpserver](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/) to expose the Forgejo SSH service. 

Okay. I patch the deployment of ingress-nginx and I get this error:

```
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age                From               Message
  ----     ------            ----               ----               -------
  Warning  FailedScheduling  93s (x3 over 11m)  default-scheduler  0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't have free ports for the requested pod ports. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 No preemption victims found for incoming pod.
```

I don't think the ssh server is already in use, because I can run services using port 22. But Kubernetes refuses to schedule pods that use that port. It could be that it's actually the other ports that are having issues:

```{.yaml}
 strategy:
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 25%
    maxUnavailable: 25%
  type: RollingUpdate
```

With this "strategy", the pods will be scaled down, but only to a certain amount... but I only have ONE pod. So it doesn't get scaled down at all, and the new pod is never able to scale up to replace it. So these settings must be changed.


## Cert-Manager

I also didn't think I would need to revisit cert-manager either. But for Coder, it needs a wildcard certificate for the service to deploy, and if you want a wildcard cert you need to use the DNS01 resolver, rather than the http01 one I am currently using. 

I found a [fork of a mainted cert-manager webhook that does nothing but add an OCI helm repo](https://github.com/lost-woods/cert-manager-porkbun-webhook). Nice!

But it 403's unless I pull by a specific tag, 1.03. In order for OCI support to work for this, I need to udpate flux, as flux 2.6 offers the OciRepository CRD in the official api (rather than just in the beta api). However, even after updating flux, these api's still remain in beta. 

Okay after waiting for a bit, it's there. Sometimes the solution is patience.

But I decide to switch to the [original version](https://github.com/mdonoughe/porkbun-webhook) instead, after realizing that I can use a GitRepository to get the helm chart, and deploy the helm chart from a path in the git repository.

### Nvidia Container Toolkit

So firstly, I need to install the Nvidia container runtime on kuberntes. 

[Here are the docs on the proprietary nvidia drivers](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers#bookworm-535). 

Firstly, enable the nonfree repo:

```{.default filename='/etc/apt/sources.list'}
#deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 12.10.0 _Bookworm_ - Official amd64 NETINST with firmware 20250315-10:09]/ bookworm contrib main non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

# bookworm-updates, to get updates before a point release is made;
# see https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html#_updates_and_backports
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm-updates main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bookworm-updates main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
```

`apt install nvidia-driver firmware-misc-nonfree`



Anyway, next is to install the Nvidia container toolkit, using the nvidia repo, and [instructions from here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

`curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg`

```{.default filename='/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list'}
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/$(ARCH) /
#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/experimental/deb/$(ARCH) /
```

`apt update`

`apt install nvidia-container-toolkit`

After this, I simply restart the rke2 service, and it the nvidia container runtime is autodetected and shows up in the `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml` file.

After this, I should be able to simply set nvidia as a runtime for certain pods, according to the [k3s docs](https://docs.k3s.io/advanced?_highlight=nvidia#alternative-container-runtime-support).


Another common step for Nvidia support in Kubernetes, is to install the [Nvidia K8s device plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin), but this requires the Nvidia container runtime to be teh *default*. I don't want this, because it gives services that don't need an Nvidia GPU access to Nvidia GPU's. I don't think I need this, however, so I won't bother.  





## IP address change

In order to fix this error, which appears after changing my ip address:

```
May 28 20:45:34 thoth rke2[6657]: time="2025-05-28T20:45:34-07:00" level=info msg="Datastore using 7925760 of 7933952 bytes after defragment"
May 28 20:45:34 thoth rke2[6657]: time="2025-05-28T20:45:34-07:00" level=info msg="Failed to test data store connection: this server is a not a member of the etcd cluster. Found [thoth-4d3eb158=https://130.166.90.206:2380], expect: thoth-4d3eb158=https://130.166.79.34:2380"
```

After changing my ip address, you just need:

`systemctl stop rke2-server`

`rke2 server --cluster-reset`

`systemctl restart rke2-server`



## Useful Stuff For the Future

* <https://github.com/flux-iac/tofu-controller>

One of my current frustrations is that Autehntik is not fully GitOps right now, and instead I am configuring it through the UI. But authentik has a [terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/goauthentik/authentik/latest/docs) which, when combined with this Flux OpenTofu setup, would allow me to GitOps the authentik config as well. 

Another option, now built in to authentik is [authentik blueprints](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/customize/blueprints/), which work with just the helm chart.

Backups:

* https://velero.io/ — backups
  * Hmm, it seems they removed the docs on rclone integration in the latest version of their docs
  * https://github.com/otwld/velero-ui
* <https://stash.run/docs/v2025.6.30/welcome/> 
  * seems to have rclone integration

Monitoring:

* Prometheus/Grafana


Add ssh keys in authentik: <https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues/2145>

## Notes for iteration two

I will eventually tear down everything and rebuild it. Some of the stuff is not worth changing right now, but when I do a rebuild I may end up making these changes.

Here's some minor stuff on the more nitpicky side:

* Have my Identity Management/Provider be hosted on idp.domainname, instead of sso.moonpiedumpl.ing
* Have secrets be set up in such a way that people can copy the configs with minimal effort.


One thing I am considering is using [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/) instead of authentik, because Zitadel supports [actions](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/actions/introduction) which are arbitrary scripts and probably cleaner to do than hacking an authentik policy to do api calls and requests.

But, Zitadel doesn't seem to supply something akin to authentik blueprints. Also, it seems to be more designed for developers 


[Cloud Native Postgres](https://cloudnative-pg.io/) is an operator that deploys postgres that is capable of [automatically handling major version upgrades](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.26/postgres_upgrades/#offline-in-place-major-upgrades), which would let me dodge the issue I encountered with Authentik's database upgrade. Although I don't know if it's truly automatic, given that it explicitly mentions that this happens if you mention a version number.

During a redeploy, I could either create multiple postgres "clusters" (I would still only be on a single node), or one big one with multiple dataabases.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) or a similar software could automatically handle updating version tags, like those of helm charts or the postgres databases mentioned above.

[Lstio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/) is a service mesh and ingress alternative, and the feature I am interested in is mTLS encryption of trafffic between pods in the cluster. Given the way that I give people access to the inside of the kubernetes cluster via Coder containers, it's worth investigating security measures like this, even if it requires more privileges than Coder users should have access to. 

Lstio also offers a [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/) which is the new hotness that will be replacing the Ingress controller in the future. 

Another thing I can consider, is given my issues with load balancers and klipper-lb above, I could set up a real or virtual router to put my kubernetes behind, and have use MetalLB or some other solution that wants me to manage the network instead.

Also, I would probably rather use Cilium or Calico instead of RKE2's combo of Flannel and Calico. I would want an eBPF data plane, and then I could use Cilium or Calico as host firewalls for blocking ssh and the kube api.

Other things to consider are options for improving security.

* Kube Api and ssh behind the firewall, requiring me to VPN into the server to access those services.
* Some form of login banner/warning banner. If I'm going to be essentially becoming my own hosting provider/infra


Openstack instead of Incus. Incus is really good, but there are so many papercuts and issues when using it that are frustrating. I originally wanted Openstack because it was a whole "cloud" and had features like s3, databases as a service, firewall as a service, containers as a service, etc. But on the reddit, people are frustrated with those services as they aren't maintained and truly reliable the way that the core openstack set of components is — for example, [zun (containers) was deprecated and then undeprecated](https://www.reddit.com/r/openstack/comments/1lelavr/is_openstack_zun_still_maintained_and_used/mywdhnj/). 

Despite that, the core Openstack components are extremely mature, with bugs ironed out, and features that Incus is lacking like the ability to create more complex networks via the UI. I totally understand why, as there isn't really a reason to deploy pfsense when Incus's ACL's and build in monitoring can cover that use case in the real world, but for an educational use case it's nice for people to be able to deploy virtual firewalls.

My big concern is attempting to get ceph on a single node. Instead of using openstack helm, I am thinking of using [Openstack Operators](https://openstack-k8s-operators.github.io/openstack-operator/) (which are actually the upstream of Red Hat Openstack on Kube although they don't tell you). However, it seems to [be much simpler with Red Hat Openshift](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openstack_services_on_openshift/18.0/html/deploying_red_hat_openstack_services_on_openshift/assembly_installing-and-preparing-the-operators#prerequisites) than if I were to deploy without it, and perhaps it's not even possible to deploy on a non-openshift platform.

But after investigating, it does look pretty gitops-able, where I should be able to take the data from [the config direcotry](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-operator/tree/main/config) and deploy that using GitOps. It also looks like I can select abitrary storage classes, instead of being locked to ceph. One disadvantage is that these operators don't seem to support as many services as Openstack Helm, like there is no support for Zun or skyline.

Another operatore option is [yaook](https://docs.yaook.cloud), but also no support for Zun or Skyline. Also, [one reddit user says that updating the operator is painful](https://www.reddit.com/r/openstack/comments/1cyrz3a/if_management_compelled_you_to_use_a/l5bjzmx/). I'll probably go with Red Hat's offering, if it works.

<https://github.com/openstack-gitops/rhoso-gitops>. Huh. Officially developed Openstack on ArgoCD.

Another thing worth looking at is [genestack](https://github.com/rackerlabs/genestack), where they managed to get longhorn support with openstack-helm, but I ccould not figure out how they did it. 

Another option is Suse Harvester... but they only officially support an ISO install. But I can find people unofficially nabbing the helm charts into their gitops:

* <https://github.com/chifu1234/flux/blob/9ad745fbb9924c318a27c641d81b71478d46f72d/apps/base/harvester/release.yaml#L13>
* <https://github.com/remikeat/cluster/blob/3754e93b7d242ab384dac68e4206565e8ed9d6a5/argocd/vm/harvester/application.yaml#L4>

I would have to deploy Rancher with the [harvester UI extension](https://github.com/harvester/harvester-ui-extension)

Argo instead of Flux: Probably not. But I am considering changing the way flux is deployed, like using the flux operator instead.


One thing I really, really want to do is get my own ASN and become my own hosting platform. But this is a far future type thing.
