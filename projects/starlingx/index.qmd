# The Why

In my [previous project](../build-server-5/), I attempted to deploy [Openstack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack) entirely with [GitOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#GitOps) methodologies, using [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/). 

I failed. Well, it didn't fail, but I think I've spent too long on it and I need to move on.

Recently, I've discovered a project that simeutaneously seems to be a distribution of OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Linux, called [StarlingX](https://www.starlingx.io/).

Also:

> [StarlingX OpenStack is installed and managed as an FluxCD application.](https://docs.starlingx.io/system_configuration/index-sysconf-d511820651f0.html#starlingx-openstack)


Now, StarlingX, sadly, is not GitOps OpenStack. Configurations to the OpenStack application are done via the command line, or via helm value files. Perhaps I can clone the flux repo they use, but truthfully, I'm not going to worry about it for now. 

# StarlingX Deployment

There are multiple deployment guides, but I am interested in the ["Simplex"](https://docs.starlingx.io/r/stx.10.0/deploy_install_guides/release/bare_metal/aio_simplex_install_kubernetes.html) install, which documents how to do an All in One install, using a single server, which is all I have.

I also care a lot about "For OpenStack only: Configure data interfaces for controller-0. Data class interfaces are vSwitch interfaces used by vSwitch to provide VM virtio vNIC connectivity to OpenStack Neutron Tenant Networks on the underlying assigned Data Network.", since I only have one physical interface in use, and the other one will be virtual.
