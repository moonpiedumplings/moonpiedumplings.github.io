# Hardware

## Selection

I wanted a machine for experimenting with devops and deep learning. That means plenty of ram, cpu, and a modest gpu.

I was very careful with my selection, and here is what I ended up with:

-   Dell Precision Tower Server 7910, with 2X intel xeon E5 2687 v4. Came with 32 GB of ram. \$300 USD
-   More memory, when added, I will get a total of 128 GB of ECC memory. \$60 USD
-   Nvidia rtx 4070 GPU, 12 GB vram. $700

## Building

Here is the inside of my server:

Anyway, I need to figure out where to put the GPU. The computer has several PCIe slots, and I want the fastest one.

And below:

I need to figure out what each of these pcie ports is. What do the numbers and color mean?

To catalog them: 

* Three black PCIe3x16 slots (all 75W)
* One blue PCIe3x16 75W + ext 225 w
* One black PCIe2x4 25 W
* One tan PCI slot

I think it is safe to assume that the color is related to wattage, not PCIe protocol. Since the computer comes with the necessary power plug that the nvidia gpu wants, it is safe to assume that any of the PCIe3x16 are optimal, although I will try to place the gpu in the best spot for cooling.

I found a [forum post](https://www.dell.com/community/Desktops-General-Read-Only/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-blue-PCIe-slot-on-the-Dell-T7910/td-p/5153034) ([wayback archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230804052739/https://www.dell.com/community/Desktops-General-Read-Only/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-blue-PCIe-slot-on-the-Dell-T7910/td-p/5153034)) where someone asked this exact question. 

An unsourced answer replied that the blue pcie slot was the primary gpu slot, so since I only have one gpu, that is where I put it. 

I found the [manual](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/precision-t7910-workstation/precision_t7910_om_pub/additional-information?guid=guid-ba746105-ecbd-4bb4-9fcc-b78681607aab&lang=en-us) for my system online, but it doesn't seem to label each pci port in images. 




I also did research into some youtube videos.

[Memory upgrading process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b499mGPEwVg)

The important thing to note about the memory upgrading process is that the memory shroud (cover) does not interfere with other processes.

However, I am trying to add the gpu, so I can get monitor output, so I can run testing suites to ensure the computer is in proper working order. 

However, the gpu does not seem to have screw slots for holding it in place. Rather than that, the entire thing rests on a single screw, as shown below.

But the GPU, is inserted:

After plugging the gpu power in:

I can turn the machine on and get monitor output:

Next step is to run the system diagnostics on the memory I currently have. Thankfully, I have an extra keyboard I can connect it to. It's a small bluetooth one, closer to a remote than something meant for typing, but it will do nicely.
