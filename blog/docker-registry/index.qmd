Recently, [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/usage/), is setting up rate limit. Unauthenticated users will be limited to 10 pulls per hour, and authenticated users will be limited to 100 pulls per hour. 

This could cause issues with setups like CGNAT, and is a very arbitrary image

So, I looked for some alternatives.


# Other Public Registries

<details><summary>Why not a self hosted registry and building our own containers?</summary>

Most people don't care about these, instead opting for local builds and registries, but for the [CCDC](https://wrccdc.org/) competition, there will be a firewall with an allowlist. It's easier to ask for a container registry to be unblocked, because container builds will get from so many different websites. In addition to that, we are not allowed to use anything that requires a login, and I do not know if that applies to Docker Hub.

## General Repos

* Google's public registry and mirror of dockerhub
    * Located at `mirror.gcr.io`
    * [Docs online](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs)
    * Because it's a mirror of Docker Hub, images available here can be searched there
* AWS ECR public registry
    * Has docker official containers and more, but is not a mirror of dockerhub
    * Located at `public.ecr.aws`
    * Can be searched at <https://gallery.ecr.aws/>
* Github container registry
    * Often where containers are built via CI/CD systems
    * Located at `ghcr.io`
    * Does not appear to be searchable

## Specialized Repos

* Linuxserver.io
    * Services specifically designed for homelabbing
    * Located at `lscr.io`
    * Searchable at <https://www.linuxserver.io/our-images>


# Local Registries

Most likely, this would also include running your own build system.

* [Official Docker Registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry)
* [Zot](https://github.com/project-zot/zot)
* [Distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution)
* [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.12.0/administration/configure-proxy-cache/)


# Build Systems

* [Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)
* [Stacker](https://github.com/project-stacker/stacker)
    * Recommended by [Zot](https://zotregistry.dev/v2.1.2/articles/building-ci-cd-pipeline/?) to build a full CI/CD pipeline
