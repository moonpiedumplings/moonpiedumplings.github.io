Cirrascale is a San Diego company that offers managed cloud computing, targeted at AI. Before my vacation, I took a tour of their hosting center. They have racks upon racks of water cooled servers.

Companies have confidentiality agreements, so I'll just keep it exceedingly vague, even if I don't consider it to be sensitive information.

First day. It was pretty nice. My skills with managing linux, containers, and virtual machines came in handy. I took initiative and stepped up when a task was offered, which was tough because I was so new. My heart was literally racing and I felt so nervous, but I didn't take on more than I could handle and I made good progress on it in that same day. In addition to that, I collaborated with the other interns on things. Overall, it was a lot of fun, and the people were very friendly.
