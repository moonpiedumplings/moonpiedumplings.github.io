Cirrascale is a San Diego company that offers managed cloud computing, targeted at AI. Before my vacation, I took a tour of their hosting center. It honestly had me awestruck, seeing rack upon rack of water cooled servers.

First day. It was pretty nice. My skills with managing linux, containers, and virtual machines came in handy. I took initiative and stepped up when a task was offered, which was tough because I was so new. My heart was literally racing and I felt so nervous, but I didn't take on more than I could handle and I made good progress on it in that same day. In addition to that, I collaborated with the other interns on things. Overall, it was a lot of fun, and the people were very friendly.

In the last two days I feel like I have done a lot, despite being so new.  I helped another intern install Ubuntu linux, and I am now working on another project, creating a proxmox image with packer to deploy using maas.

Since then, I have completed created an image, although I haven't tested yet. In addition to that, I got to post all my code on github:
